escape should dismisses escapable menus (like the escape menu)

volume buttons skip dialog....

audio volume controls

maybe have the element turn around when talked to

the treasure battler should probs be closed

For now, monsters can only kill you reactively if one of your action fails, but mb i should have more proactive monster attacks.
mobile needs a bigger font

?touch handler interupts boy walking
?touch handler interupts text during battle
?mota crashed during basilisk figh and it didnt pop again

?sometimes events are doubled

?animation at the end of clue is weird (blink screen)

we need to reset scrolling at level change

??some evnets are in walls

revisit default PLAYER_ACTION and add variety

the ability tree doesnt overflow scroll :/

?when testing i had a viper battle go out of existence

?i think the transition between levels is fucked up probably because of concurrency

better battler for statue, corpse
