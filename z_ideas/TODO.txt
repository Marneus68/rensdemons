POPULATE FIRST DUNGEON

traps
remember encounters we fled ?
the treasure battler should probs be close

- Should there be randomness, for instance weapon efficiency?
- And/or have monsters able to kill you out of the blue instead of flavor text?
- Should the level/xp be more prominent? right now it's a bit hidden for RP reasons





animation at battle start is weird cause it expands far outside the screen if youre way below
animation at the end of clue is weird (blink screen)
we need to reset scrolling at level change
statue of the godess goes off screens
