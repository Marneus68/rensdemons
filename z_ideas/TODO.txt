properly center planet

zindex is sometimes broken on mobile

dont forget to do a proper title screen in particula for mobile

escape should dismisses escapable menus (like the escape menu)

text banner is too small and skewed on the left :/

maybe have the element turn around when talked to

- walking speed is too slow by default on keyboard
- check behavior of maintained click
- hitbox tree too big?

improve keyboard controls (cf mota) and keyboard speed (cf robin)

have an animation for click target
