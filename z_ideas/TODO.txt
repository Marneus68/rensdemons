zindex is sometimes broken on mobile

dont forget to do a proper title screen in particula for mobile

escape should dismisses escapable menus (like the escape menu)

maybe have the element turn around when talked to

- walking speed is too slow by default on keyboard
- check behavior of maintained click
- hitbox tree too big?

improve keyboard controls (cf mota) and keyboard speed (cf robin)

have an animation for click target

music

proximity triggered fights?? traps??



do i need to track visual elements in currentlevel or can it just be object.visual_element
its causing confusion cause when i try to remove an item from the level it may be tied to the wrong version of its sprite :/ (think after a battle)
in fact currentlevel should probably keep all objects in a map keyed by hash
