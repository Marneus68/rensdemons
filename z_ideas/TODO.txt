dont forget to do a proper title screen in particula for mobile

escape should dismisses escapable menus (like the escape menu)

- walking speed is too slow by default on keyboard
- check behavior of maintained click
- hitbox tree too big?

improve keyboard controls (cf mota) and keyboard speed (cf robin)

have an animation for click target

music

proximity triggered fights?? traps??

we do not remember the state of the level (how many monsters died...)

!SAVE POINT HITBOX IN THE WRONG PLACE

SAVES IN AUTOSAVE SLOT IF THERES NO SAVE???

* CURRENTLEVEL saves and gets position in a weid place
* Does BATTLE really need to save and load currentlevel?
