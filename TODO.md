Different stories and depending on your reaction you tip, it could be the same story from different pov

Mb options are run kill listen and when u listen u get a story with random rewards and its always the story of Ren, mb it's his mom, but the jackpot is the story of the minstrel. Mb smthing like a minstrel who couldn't tell his own story
