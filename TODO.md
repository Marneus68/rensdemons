# FINISH SHARED EVENTS




##GeniusProdigy
Genius is like from our pov you could come from the future at any moment  and we wouldn't notice. That's what's hard about observing you there isn't Rly much abnormality from the outside

Mb like it's pretty awesome how you manipulate the multiversd without realizing there were times were it Rly felt like you should have died


##PreciousChild
Mb honey can be like you're my hero etc
naive children questions, why are we doing ethis, etc...
He asks very innocent questions like why do you have to fight


Mb traduire ce débat en une discussion genre est ce qu'on doit tenter quand même si on ddg pas sur que ce soit objectivement bien  et oui on doit tenter parce que ça peut être mieux. Could be naïve qu'est-il  question of precious child

metaethics debate: everything is arbitrary, do you really need to fight? the answer is yes.

##StreetSmart
Smart guy mb repair weapon?



##DisguisedPrincess
Baudrillard? What's baudrillard Ian about the pre ending run ?
thing with narrator???


He can be likr high on weed like bro erre like in a story bro. The story happens now. Bro it's happening to us like this is the story right now

I bet they're already telling our tale right now
What do you mean

Doesn't our adventure feel cliche? Doesn't it feel like we're in a game? Ou alors a l'opposé : I can't wait to imagine how they'll tell our story

Aren't you always telling yours le your own story in your head

What if we're in a simulation right now? How would you even know


THE STORY IS THE ONTOLOGICAL GROUNDING OF YOUR EXISTENCE

# TROPES need thinking ---------------------------------------------
- an old lady arrives, ofc she wants to help and gives you crap
- a flashback that you know you survived

>> You exist as a self because you’re being conceived of as a self, be it only by yourself. Therefore you only exist because theres a story about yourself. The story is the ontological grounding of your existence.

# CASINO ----------------------------------------------------
- a casino in vegas (and lootboxes) > the rng was helpful/not
- gambling as pseudorandom next to an altar
- implemented as a special shop ?
you ask them if theyre random or pseudorandom or deterministic << like wtf how would you even know in universe, "if i were to do the same action twice would it have the same outcome?"

# MORE HEAVEN  ----------------------------------------------------

- add a link to the demo in heaven
- random itch io / steam game
https://itch.io/randomizer post ??
http://store.steampowered.com/explore/random/


# PROOF GODDESS  ----------------------------------------------------
- You thought you got powers because you killed god but it's because you understood on some lvl that the world is made by you for you
- Explain that the console is like magic words that change the fabric of the universe
- WHO makes you do it??
- You can do anything you want , why are you still following the game
- The SYSTEM goddess exploits the energy of someone stuck in a sollipsist simulation (like SNS feeding from ppl's attention by    trapping them in truman show filter bubble), energy from running in the loop
- the goddess SAVED your soul (save/save) as confirmation when you save
- The cycle of replay with the promise of a true ending is precisely what the system exploits

# PROOF MIRROR  ----------------------------------------------------

# STATS DISPLAY  ----------------------------------------------------

- Keep more stats and reuse the Stat of ren's desth
>> In heaven a stats memorial mb written in a picture smthing a big swag
>> use it in conversations??


# BATTLE ENCOUNTERS  ----------------------------------------------------
- more?
- more battle encounters (world map ruins, hellsmaw skeleton)
- double check battle/encounters especially sprites
- review battle_debris add a few more actions for rubble treasures
- civilian battlers assets battle civilians suck, also theres some sprites in assets/battle that are not used



# BUGFIXES  ----------------------------------------------------
- test on edge, epsecially functions starting by _, mb the nested ones
- Make debug.html user friendly: When you go to game folder, theres a debug.exe game that launches the same environments behind the scenes?
- if theres a guy behind a house interaction interacts with the house (most prominent object)
- check save/disk size
- add rens parent sendoff/house before trial?
- When u know a weapon defeats a enemy you should know how many steps to chose the most efficients
- dodger initial position a litl bit more up
- break line bug <br><br>When you look at what suits your views<br<br>/&gt;When you idealize the past<br>When you follow that which feels true...
- why does battletree have lists as leaves and not simply state?
- shop, trainer, player_action have a bit of language text, DISK?
- palette has functions that return objects, strings and functinos that just outright change the colors
- The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. The document will render with garbled text in some browser configurations if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range. The character encoding of the page must be declared in the document or in the transfer protocol.
- sometimes audio fail with testing.html:1 Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: Failed to load because no supported source was found. << ONLY ON CHROME DEV
- can we remove self adjustement from draw() now that we hardcode the dimensions of all sprites when theres filling?? mb noter for battle sprites etc....
- cache ressources  regenerate resource preloading list
- replace js prompt() and try https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework) then https://github.com/greenheartgames/greenworks for steam achievements? http://twinery.org/questions/2934/steam-greenworks-with-twine-how-make-work-for-achievements

# FILLER CHECK  ----------------------------------------------------
- the hardcoded temporary items sometimes dont have a placeholder, like 025harpies, mb we should automate placeholding
- graphical audit from >= first town
- ZONES DONT OVERLAP OR IT MAY DOUBLE SPAWN ??
- spawn chara on exit bands, its safer
See 051_pandemonium_room and 012_trees
- A look for foreknowledge opportunities
