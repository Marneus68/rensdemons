# MORE HEAVEN  ----------------------------------------------------

- proofread goddess and mirror
- Explain that the console is like magic words that change the fabric of the universe
- WHO makes you do it??
- The SYSTEM goddess exploits the energy of someone stuck in a sollipsist simulation (like SNS feeding from ppl's attention by    trapping them in truman show filter bubble), energy from running in the loop
- add a link to the demo in heaven
- the goddess SAVED your soul (save/save) as confirmation when you save
- The cycle of replay with the promise of a true ending is precisely what the system exploits
- random itch io / steam game
