- plan side characters with tropes/ideas here. put the tropes either in side characters or in more battle items


---------------------------------------- BACKSIDE CONTENT:
- walkthrough
- NPC thoughts, People whispering on the edge of the viewport
- review ideas
- visual glitches (overlay?)
- more language options for ledger console
- alternate endings for goddess/heaven:
a path where you discuss the truth with the goddess (you're the goddess all along, goddess= player avatar, there's no escaping the system, you're trapped.
>> Step 1: youre trapped in the system, it keeps exploiting your energy,
>> step 2: you ARE the system)
>> Ren, you have the power to communicate with another world
World: "END OF WORLD", // kill goddess and ask for a new world
This infinite loop of resets has no end in the game. There will always be another challenge as long as the player exists. This highlights the fact that the player is the true source of evil in the game world, because all this suffering only exists for their experience. The true boss that you must defeat is the player, the one who orchestrated all these Demon Lords, and the only way to kill it is to literally stop playing: the only winning move is not to play.
Line: "END OF LINE", // code, console, like demo a room where you can build your own universe using javascript
Universe: "END OF UNIVERSE", // Fork on git = true end

- Sometimes the game would crash with a very peculiar error code or error messags “help us”
- connections with our world in heaven, popups/includes to wikipedia?

---------------------------------------- OPTIONAL CONTENT:
- dungeons: tree, sirens, hawks, slimes
- town2 survivors rescue!
- hans dog somewhere
- more furniture ^^ (city specific ??)
- more itembattles for dungeons and world, more battle encounters (world map ruins, hellsmaw skeleton)
- more bed and jar actions
- party members:
>  description in party.js,
>  attacks in languge,
>  encounter+battle
>> the truth about the power of ren (how he goes back in time to alternate realities)
>> He's faking it to infiltrate the enemy (traitorfisher)
>> Artist vessel for god inspiration
>> Save and load : rez someone to kill them again

- review battle_debris add a few more actions for rubble treasures
- add rens parent sendoff/house before trial?
- ideas in todos in villager

---------------------------------------- GRAPHIC REWORK:
- audit from >= first town
- civilian battlers assets battle civilians suck, also theres some sprites in assets/battle that are not used
- sprites for party members
- object/buildings: need better buildings and differnt building styles for different cities?
- figure out rocks: mb the rocks that have straight bottom should be reserved for edges??
- check walking on small sprites (ie pebbles, etc):  hills are fixed at the position where they are and the character appears behind them when they walk on it, floors are not rerendered when the sprite has loaded. /   pebbles hide the sprite when walked on /   > mb things should have an option to be indexed by the top
- decorate stores
- the treasure battler should probs be closed
- mb revamp party screen with icons

---------------------------------------- TODO
- credit gfroad sumnmoning circle or replace ti with rpgmaker
- spam space bar in battle makes the option menu reappear on fight
- test on edge, epsecially functions starting by _, mb the nested ones
- change color scheme doesnt change fog or map bg
- proper title screen and death screen, esp for mobile
- artifact have special sound effects
- Make debug.html user friendly: When you go to game folder, theres a debug.exe game that launches the same environments behind the scenes?
- make experience menu multi tiered
- if theres a guy behind a house interaction interacts with the house (most prominent object)
- different sound walking on map
- Skip dodge phase at high level?
- title mirroring the number of loops: Ultimate Illusion I, II, III... (or just Ren's demons I)
- did i fix word break in little textbox but not in CenteredTextMenu ?? https://github.com/yo252yo/rensdemons/commit/45d726acf5d6e3ff75444e5c90bd045d5150fa40 ??
- why does battletree have lists as leaves and not simply state?
- shop, trainer, player_action have a bit of language text, DISK?
- palette has functions that return objects, strings and functinos that just outright change the colors

The character encoding of the page must be declared in the document or in the transfer protocol.
- sometimes audio fail with testing.html:1 Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: Failed to load because no supported source was found. << ONLY ON CHROME DEV
- can we remove self adjustement from draw() now that we hardcode the dimensions of all sprites when theres filling?? mb noter for battle sprites etc....
