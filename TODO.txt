properly center planet

zindex is sometimes broken on mobile

dont forget to do a proper title screen in particula for mobile

escape menu

what to do when menu overflows the screen

escape should dismisses escapable menus (like the escape menu)

options doesnt have a good way back path when its accessed from the main titlescreen menu
(titlescreen should regen the menu when its not there)
