* DODGE:
click cd of menu prevents dodge ????
- dodge screen feels empty

NO REPRO:
- during his demo playthrough M would respawn in the middle of the church every time he enters
- during his demo playthrough M fireball doesnt get crossed when useless

-----------------

- real game when you enter harpie peak youre spawned on wrong location

- textures for floor

- check that decor is placed before fights even the ones that are static/fixed (can be done as we add textures)


- CAREFUL dont autosave when the character isnt placed! Mb safeguard this by autosaving with a 1s delay or smthing




its a pain to pass around the generator everywhere, and i get confused between generator and seed, maybe i should call smthing like DICTIONARY.get_generator()


- rest of the story
> fast travel after getting artifact?
> react after gathering 3 artifacts
> story, city destroyed, etc...
- optional events in world map
