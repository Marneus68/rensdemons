Assume that a zone is safe once you've cleared it / clear whole floor before moving on

the only real power of the hero is respawn so they win by brute force in long run, cf yuusha yoshihiko
The SYSTEM goddess exploits the energy of someone stuck in a sollipsist simulation (like SNS feeding from ppl's attention by trapping them in truman show filter bubble)
so youre quantum immortal!!

---------------------------------------- TOWN4 FEMME FATALE
FemmeFatale: "FemmeFatale", // prostitute/ femme fatale
// town4 debauch
something about dating sims? true end etc... i know theres a series of choice to woo you
dont you hate how everyone else seems very robotic, always doing the same things
more fake choices that i know are fake

- You can trust repeatable lines of npcs
- AI or NPCs endlessly repeating the same phrase (Hey! Look! Listen!)
- your conversation is weird and unnatural

---------------------------------------- GRAPHIC REWORK:
- audit from >= first town
- civilian battlers assets battle civilians suck, also theres some sprites in assets/battle that are not used
- object/buildings: need better buildings and differnt building styles for different cities?
- figure out rocks: mb the rocks that have straight bottom should be reserved for edges??
- check walking on small sprites (ie pebbles, etc):  hills are fixed at the position where they are and the character appears behind them when they walk on it, floors are not rerendered when the sprite has loaded. /   pebbles hide the sprite when walked on /   > mb things should have an option to be indexed by the top
- decorate stores
- the treasure battler should probs be closed
- mb revamp party screen with icons

---------------------------------------- TROPES
- add comment about how anything can fit in my bags
- i expect more at the end of maou fight cause important enemies usually have stages
- Whale: Fights you're supposed to lose
- a casino in vegas (and lootboxes) > the rng was helpful/not
- when you open a menu, time stops and aerith says something when you're opening menus / matrix effect, you slow down the time when you think
- hellsmaw: dont worry we're supposed to Encounter the big boss before youre ready, we're way too underlevel
- invisible walls dialog at the end of the world
- self awareness of weird hitboxes like church
- review the fissure temple to make sure its obvious "every problem has a solution" "a lock means theres a key" etc... i know we'll find a hint in this place!
- UpbeatDojikko: you have the power to communicate with another world
- UpbeatDojikko:  I cN see your future you'll kill the bosses
- an old lady arrives, ofc she wants to help and gives you crap
- a flashback that you know you survived
- wiseold: “Insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results”
- add death flag in hells maw before aetith death


---------------------------------------- AERITH EVENTS
>> should these be a part of a pool of metaevents that can happen anywhere? should they include conversations with other characters???
- event from aerith: Don't you think it's weird how we always find what we need on our way
- event from aerith: isnt it weird that merchants buy all your shit
- event from aerith: do we not need breaks? no sleep or toilet
- event from aerith: how do you know youre immortal
- event from aerith: you have an intuition about where to go O.o
- conversation about open worlds
- event from aerith: i cant hurt you, no friendly fire
      "I know where to go/how to progress/what to do": i.e. when you need to // game gives me clue for next location
- event from aerith: i always pray before a risky event or when i sense the story might branch soon. You should save before risky event,  Save point before bosses
- reference to the fact that there's always a crafting system
