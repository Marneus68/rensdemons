! if we ever save in a generated level, it'll remember the save position every time we try to enter this level after :/


graphic overhaul:
- audit from >= first town
- need to do civilian battlers
- need to check sprites for party
- object/buildings: need better buildings and differnt building styles for different cities?

- figure out rocks: mb the rocks that have straight bottom should be reserved for edges??

> should non boss battlers have transparency


can i zoom on object item during fights ??



- pandemonium:
share plants with altars
the key to survival -> progress -> success -> happiness -> understanding -> victory

hidden ending:
- heaven: squares linked without any order
