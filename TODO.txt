---------------------------------------- GODESS ending path:
- go see the Goddess and ask wtf, Goddess says this is futile there's a system we're trapped she's trapped too. youre trapped in the system, it keeps exploiting your energy,
> fake destroy the world:  ending.World: "END OF WORLD", // kill goddess and ask for a new world

- didnt work, theres always something that brings it back: reveal that youre the mastermind, you are the system, the goddess is working for you
theres higher being controlling us, they see everything and know everything, we're pawns of destiny
> but Ren, you have the power to communicate with another world, mb you can stop this madness
> Rly destroy files? Impossible I think / Game can't delete itself but it can lock itself
>> Communication: "END OF Communication",

>>  There will always be another challenge as long as the player exists. This highlights the fact that the player is the true source of evil in the game world, because all this suffering only exists for their experience. The true boss that you must defeat is the player, the one who orchestrated all these Demon Lords, and the only way to kill it is to literally stop playing: the only winning move is not to play.
>> Universe: "END OF UNIVERSE", // Fork on git = true end

---------------------------------------- GRAPHIC REWORK:
- audit from >= first town
- civilian battlers assets battle civilians suck, also theres some sprites in assets/battle that are not used
- sprites for party members
- object/buildings: need better buildings and differnt building styles for different cities?
- figure out rocks: mb the rocks that have straight bottom should be reserved for edges??
- check walking on small sprites (ie pebbles, etc):  hills are fixed at the position where they are and the character appears behind them when they walk on it, floors are not rerendered when the sprite has loaded. /   pebbles hide the sprite when walked on /   > mb things should have an option to be indexed by the top
- decorate stores
- the treasure battler should probs be closed
- mb revamp party screen with icons

---------------------------------------- TROPES
- add comment about how anything can fit in my bags
- i expect more at the end of maou fight cause important enemies usually have stages
- Whale: Fights you're supposed to lose
- a casino in vegas (and lootboxes)



---------------------------------------- TODO
- credit gfroad sumnmoning circle or replace ti with rpgmaker
- spam space bar in battle makes the option menu reappear on fight
- test on edge, epsecially functions starting by _, mb the nested ones
- change color scheme doesnt change fog or map bg
- proper title screen and death screen, esp for mobile
- artifact have special sound effects
- Make debug.html user friendly: When you go to game folder, theres a debug.exe game that launches the same environments behind the scenes?
- make experience menu multi tiered
- if theres a guy behind a house interaction interacts with the house (most prominent object)
- different sound walking on map
- add rens parent sendoff/house before trial?
- ideas in todos in villager
- a suicide function?
- Skip dodge phase at high level?
- title mirroring the number of loops: Ultimate Illusion I, II, III... (or just Ren's demons I)
- did i fix word break in little textbox but not in CenteredTextMenu ?? https://github.com/yo252yo/rensdemons/commit/45d726acf5d6e3ff75444e5c90bd045d5150fa40 ??
- why does battletree have lists as leaves and not simply state?
- shop, trainer, player_action have a bit of language text, DISK?
- palette has functions that return objects, strings and functinos that just outright change the colors
- The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared.

- sometimes audio fail with testing.html:1 Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: Failed to load because no supported source was found. << ONLY ON CHROME DEV
- can we remove self adjustement from draw() now that we hardcode the dimensions of all sprites when theres filling?? mb noter for battle sprites etc....
