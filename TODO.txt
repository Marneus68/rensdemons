- review battle_debris add a few more actions for rubble treasures

---------------------------------------- GRAPHIC REWORK:
- audit from >= first town
- civilian battlers assets battle civilians suck, also theres some sprites in assets/battle that are not used
- sprites for party members
- object/buildings: need better buildings and differnt building styles for different cities?
- figure out rocks: mb the rocks that have straight bottom should be reserved for edges??
- check walking on small sprites (ie pebbles, etc):  hills are fixed at the position where they are and the character appears behind them when they walk on it, floors are not rerendered when the sprite has loaded. /   pebbles hide the sprite when walked on /   > mb things should have an option to be indexed by the top
- decorate stores
- the treasure battler should probs be closed
- mb revamp party screen with icons

---------------------------------------- TODO
- credit gfroad sumnmoning circle or replace ti with rpgmaker
- spam space bar in battle makes the option menu reappear on fight
- test on edge, epsecially functions starting by _, mb the nested ones
- change color scheme doesnt change fog or map bg
- proper title screen and death screen, esp for mobile
- artifact have special sound effects
- make experience menu multi tiered
- if theres a guy behind a house interaction interacts with the house (most prominent object)
- different sound walking on map
- Skip dodge phase at high level?

- why does battletree have lists as leaves and not simply state?
- shop, trainer, player_action have a bit of language text, DISK?
- palette has functions that return objects, strings and functinos that just outright change the colors
