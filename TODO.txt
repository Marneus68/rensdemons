S_GooFloor  is not used at all

S_TilingFloor ?? only in trial, could be fun



- pandemonium extra room,
- pandemonium deco, (share plants with altars)
- pandemonium events, especially intro
- visual glitches (overlay?)
- achievement menu
  In party. Add and inventory. Add we can make stats for achieveemnts
  It's a bit ugly how we're using underscore for hidden abilities 
- reset at reroll (SAVE.make_new_game): keep martyrdom and battletree?? but if we keep battletree we dont get XP anymore!!! so we should just force XP score to be 0 at the beginning for the first encounter of the run for each monster, so that the first encounter gives mass XP! Keep it as ability?
  Make sure that downloading a save merges and not overwrites the disk
