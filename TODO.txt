properly center planet

zindex is sometimes broken on mobile

dont forget to do a proper title screen in particula for mobile

what to do when menu overflows the screen

escape should dismisses escapable menus (like the escape menu)

text banner is too small and skewed on the left :/

maybe have the element turn around when talked to


- walking speed is too slow by default on keyboard
- at the end of hide and seek the event can trigger several times (popping multiple priests)
- check behavior of maintained click
- hitbox tree too big?

improve keyboard controls (cf mota) and keyboard speed (cf robin)
