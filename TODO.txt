decide title
be careful, write in present and second person, also dont make things spawn on doors
should we meet the king?


- pick audios

> all monsters
-  battle attributes
- attacks


make itembattles in all nature (trial, world, 3 dungeons)
add a few more actions for rubble


> fast travel after getting artifact?
> react after gathering 3 artifacts


- monsters in world map
- optional events in world map
- optional dungeons
- optional party members:
  description in party.js,
  attacks in languge,
  encounter+battle


  could the random text events provide XP by being like itembattles ?



should we do a cemetary?
