properly center planet

zindex is sometimes broken on mobile

dont forget to do a proper title screen in particula for mobile

what to do when menu overflows the screen

escape should dismisses escapable menus (like the escape menu)

text banner is too small and skewed on the left :/

maybe have the element turn around when talked to


phone sometimes allows scrolling and double tap (ex title menu)

battle menu too small on phones
