Redesign level:
- Trop denemis
- Move corpse ?


need people in Houses
make chair with table
chests NEED to be tilted
put random treasures (i.e make battleobjects commands trigger some events sometimes.


is it a problem that battleobject only has 1 choice in the battle? should i unlock two at once ?
