NEW INTERFACE:
- Mobile skip dial by button tap not screen tap
- mettre une icone autosave

limit keys to skip dial (ctrl/alt)

better dialog for xp, explaining where it comes from (discover/explore)

Loot un peu plus, en particulier le premier encounter

Shorthand for text you read a lot so you dont have to read too much (spells, etc)

Si tu as deja parle a un humain c’est bizarre qu’un autre te dise la meme chose
> turn ppl into battleobjects? ??

2 action par object
BATTLEOBJECT add ignore is a random option



--------------------------
REAL GAME CHANGES:

GO OVER EVERYTHING:
- textures for floor
- check that decor is placed before fights even the ones that are static/fixed (can be done as we add textures)
- CAREFUL dont autosave when the character isnt placed! Mb safeguard this by autosaving with a 1s delay or smthing


- when you enter harpie peak youre spawned on wrong location

--------------------------
its a pain to pass around the generator everywhere, and i get confused between generator and seed, maybe i should call smthing like DICTIONARY.get_generator()


- rest of the story
> fast travel after getting artifact?
> react after gathering 3 artifacts
> story, city destroyed, etc...
- optional events in world map
- optional dungeons
- optional party members:
>  description in party.js,
