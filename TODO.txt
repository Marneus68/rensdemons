new filler type for most deco??
im seeing overlapping deco spawn in unwalkable spots, is this on purpose?



- deco fissure/hellsmaw
- fissure flavor events and text

- 2nd lieutenant fight ("WIP BOSS START TEXT.") + end of fight

- hellsmaw 12 and 13 have different decor
- hell
- pandemonium:
the key to survival -> progress -> success -> happiness -> understanding -> victory

hidden ending:

- heaven
squares linked without any order


------------------------------------

should we rly limit to 3 choices when its inquiries, like _004/_priest?

music loop

check walking on small sprites
