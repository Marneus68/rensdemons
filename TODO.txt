- make sure the character with FOW is always centered
> debug move camera even when no fog

- when you interact with someone/something, and wish to interact again, you need to move away and back rather than just pressing Enter again. (remember direction)



--------------------------
GO OVER EVERYTHING:
- shift everything by 1k pixels
- textures for floor
- check that decor is placed before fights even the ones that are static/fixed (can be done as we add textures)
- CAREFUL dont autosave when the character isnt placed! Mb safeguard this by autosaving with a 1s delay or smthing




- 010 worldmap armament trigger event repeats every time i exit a battle in debug mode
- when you enter harpie peak youre spawned on wrong location
