- make sure the character with FOW is always centered

- E Z as interaction keys

- when you interact with someone/something, and wish to interact again, you need to move away and back rather than just pressing Enter again. (remember direction)

- Add self aware messages mb you need to farm when you cant win a battle

- less loud effects by default

- its a pain to pass around the generator everywhere, and i get confused between generator and seed, maybe i should call smthing like DICTIONARY.get_generator()

--------------------------
GO OVER EVERYTHING:
- textures for floor
- check that decor is placed before fights even the ones that are static/fixed (can be done as we add textures)
- CAREFUL dont autosave when the character isnt placed! Mb safeguard this by autosaving with a 1s delay or smthing


- 010 worldmap armament trigger event repeats every time i exit a battle in debug mode
- when you enter harpie peak youre spawned on wrong location
