lvl scales too fast with xp

1xp for text event

tool vs loot clarification (what can i sell??)

clrl we should lower prices especially consumables

make bosses harder (4 ally)

forbid fire elixir for debris in treasure loot

clearly highlight the currently explored option
didnt find a solution to highlight the actions that one started exploring, they conflict with the other actions with trailing spaces "  " (PLAYER_ACTIONS.internal name) like battleitems. maybe we could make prefixes and postfixes trailing spaces? thats a bit gross tho

only lose one arrow trotal not one per shot

CANNOT BUY BREATHING POTION!~

IO needs to depend on debug
