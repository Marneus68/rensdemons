Needs thinking:

- TreeDungeon + SavageChild

- more fake choices that i know are fake
- "I've been here before and I know you"
- more death flags, flags in general (Before you go there let me warn you)
- reference to the fact that there's always a crafting system
- “Insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results”




















---------------------------------------- GODDESS endings path:
- go see the Goddess and ask wtf, Goddess says this is futile there's a system we're trapped she's trapped too. youre trapped in the system, it keeps exploiting your energy,
> fake destroy the world:  ending.World: "END OF WORLD", // kill goddess and ask for a new world

- didnt work, theres always something that brings it back: reveal that youre the mastermind, you are the system, the goddess is working for you
theres higher being controlling us, they see everything and know everything, we're pawns of destiny
I'm not the goddess the goddess lived in another world altogether you cannot comprehend the world of the gods much less visualize if but you are a special vessel that bridges the world with this one in  way you're a lot like me goddess you're my dual
talk directly to the player???
you think youre the most free, yet youre the most constrained, you can only do what the game allows
talk about ideology and cooptation
> but Ren, you have the power to communicate with another world, mb you can stop this madness
> Rly destroy files? Impossible I think / Game can't delete itself but it can lock itself
>>> Rd is the portal at the border between fiction and reality
>> Communication: "END OF Communication",

>>  There will always be another challenge as long as the player exists. This highlights the fact that the player is the true source of evil in the game world, because all this suffering only exists for their experience. The true boss that you must defeat is the player, the one who orchestrated all these Demon Lords, and the only way to kill it is to literally stop playing: the only winning move is not to play.
>> Universe: "END OF UNIVERSE", // Fork on git = true end


const ENDINGS = {
  World: "END OF WORLD", // kill goddess and ask for a new world
  Line: "END OF LINE", // code
  Universe: "END OF UNIVERSE", // Fork on git
  // road, world, ear, year, universe, trail, story, day, journey
}

The system makes this villain self sustaining cycle to provide a diversion
It's basically matrix: Kill the bad guy > Bad guy isn't so bad > You're trapped by the System > You are the system
!! All ideology is like Video-game ideology  = only allows you to move within the game
This is a game about Berkeley’s philosophy highlighting that the world only exists when perceived. The main point is that the world and the NPCs only exist when they are on screen: they only exist for the player and because of them. The title is a reference to Descarte’s demons. Consequence is that you litteraly make your own universe

Don't forget that the goddess needs blood
The world of gods is not fair so the goddess toys with us
insist that counter culture movements always get coopted

dont you hate how everyone else seems very robotic, always doing the same things

- You can trust repeatable lines of npcs
- AI or NPCs endlessly repeating the same phrase (Hey! Look! Listen!)
- your conversation is weird and unnatural

---------------------------------------- GRAPHIC REWORK:
- audit from >= first town
- civilian battlers assets battle civilians suck, also theres some sprites in assets/battle that are not used
- sprites for party members
- object/buildings: need better buildings and differnt building styles for different cities?
- figure out rocks: mb the rocks that have straight bottom should be reserved for edges??
- check walking on small sprites (ie pebbles, etc):  hills are fixed at the position where they are and the character appears behind them when they walk on it, floors are not rerendered when the sprite has loaded. /   pebbles hide the sprite when walked on /   > mb things should have an option to be indexed by the top
- decorate stores
- the treasure battler should probs be closed
- mb revamp party screen with icons

---------------------------------------- TROPES

- invisible walls dialog at the end of the world
- self awareness of weird hitboxes like church
- review the fissure temple to make sure its obvious "every problem has a solution" "a lock means theres a key" etc... i know we'll find a hint in this place!
- UpbeatDojikko: you have the power to communicate with another world
- UpbeatDojikko:  I cN see your future you'll kill the bosses
- an old lady arrives, ofc she wants to help and gives you crap
- a flashback that you know you survived

---------------------------------------- AERITH EVENTS
>> should these be a part of a pool of metaevents that can happen anywhere? should they include conversations with other characters???
- event from aerith: Don't you think it's weird how we always find what we need on our way
- event from aerith: isnt it weird that merchants buy all your shit

- event from aerith: how do you know youre immortal
- event from aerith: you have an intuition about where to go O.o
- conversation about open worlds
- event from aerith: i cant hurt you, no friendly fire
      "I know where to go/how to progress/what to do": i.e. when you need to // game gives me clue for next location
- event from aerith: i always pray before a risky event or when i sense the story might branch soon. You should save before risky event,  Save point before bosses

- why does battletree have lists as leaves and not simply state?
- shop, trainer, player_action have a bit of language text, DISK?
- palette has functions that return objects, strings and functinos that just outright change the colors
- The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. The document will render with garbled text in some browser configurations if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range.
