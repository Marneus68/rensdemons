--------------------------
REAL GAME CHANGES:

GO OVER EVERYTHING:
- textures for floor
- check that decor is placed before fights even the ones that are static/fixed (can be done as we add textures)
- CAREFUL dont autosave when the character isnt placed! Mb safeguard this by autosaving with a 1s delay or smthing


- when you enter harpie peak youre spawned on wrong location

--------------------------
its a pain to pass around the generator everywhere, and i get confused between generator and seed, maybe i should call smthing like DICTIONARY.get_generator()
