decide title

be careful, write in present and second person, also dont make things spawn on doors


should we meet the king?

- pick audios
- story: dungeons (todo levels)

 text encounters: harpies lvls, squid lvls, mushroom lvl, world


> all monsters battle attributes
> fast travel after getting artifact?
> react after gathering 3 artifacts


- monsters in world map
- optional events in world map
- optional dungeons
- optional party members:
  description in party.js,
  attacks in languge,
  encounter+battle


  YOU STILL GET LOOT WHEN RUNNING AWAY!!!!
  ANIMATION START BATTLE ON WORLDMAP IS SHIT, needs a better lock mechanism also  to not double trigger

  OTHER TYPES OF EVENT DON HAVE SIZE AND COLOR IN CONSTRUCTOR FOR WORLD MAP I THINK
  on world map we want the event to actually be small but on the other maps we want the hitbox only to be small

should we do a cemetary?
