add money?

reconnect with best friend

add shops and trainer

maybe i should do a list of all items i expect in the game early on


customization: name choice?


hills are fixed at the position where they are and the character appears behind them when they walk on it, floors are not rerendered when the sprite has loaded.


change color scheme doesnt change fog or map bg??

could map ability/inventory way with a dictionary key

const ABILITY[ELEMENTS] = ["Fireball", "Ice_bolt", "Thunder", "Storm"];


also factor commonalities between inventory and abilities
