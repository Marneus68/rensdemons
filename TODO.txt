decide title
be careful, write in present and second person, also dont make things spawn on doors
should we meet the king?


- pick audios


 special encounters: harpies lvl, squid lvl, mushroom lvl, world:
 addevent_battle(name, weight);
 addevent_rubble(item, weight);
 addevent_treasure(item, weight, count);
 addevent_text(text, weight);

> all monsters
-  battle attributes
- attacks





> fast travel after getting artifact?
> react after gathering 3 artifacts


- monsters in world map
- optional events in world map
- optional dungeons
- optional party members:
  description in party.js,
  attacks in languge,
  encounter+battle


  could the random text events provide XP by being like itembattles ?



should we do a cemetary?
