This is a game about Berkeley’s philosophy highlighting that the world only exists when perceived. The main point is that the world and the NPCs only exist when they are on screen: they only exist for the player and because of them. The title is a reference to Descarte’s demons. Consequence is that you litteraly make your own universe
