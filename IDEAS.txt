This is a game about Berkeley’s philosophy highlighting that the world only exists when perceived. The main point is that the world and the NPCs only exist when they are on screen: they only exist for the player and because of them. The title is a reference to Descarte’s demons. Consequence is that you litteraly make your own universe
“Insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results”

insist that counter culture movements always get coopted

the only real power of the hero is respawn so they win by brute force in long run, cf yuusha yoshihiko
