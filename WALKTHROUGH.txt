                     1. INTRODUCTION                                   [0000]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

This is a guide to the game Ren's Demons by yo252yo. This is my first time writing a walkthrough, I hope I'll do good enough of a job to help those who need it.
I wanted to write a guide for this little indie game because I felt that it was a pretty interesting project, but parts of it are pretty challenging. The ending, in particular, can be tricky to understand. With this guide, I hope that I can share my passion for this game, and make it accessible to everyone!
I'll try to keep the spoilers to a minimum and properly tag them, but this is a text file describing all the contents of the game, so you'll have to do your part too ^^


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     1.1 ABOUT THE GAME                                [0100]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Ren's Demons is definitely a weird game. It's a web browser game (if you got it anywhere else, know that what you're getting is actually a web browser) that is kind of a mix between a traditional JRPG, a text-based adventure game (chose your own adventure) or a visual novel, maybe.


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     1.2 TROUBLESHOOTING                               [0200]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

If you're having problems running the game, try another web browser, operating system or device. The game is written in HTML and javascript, so any web browser should do the trick. Apple enforces arbitrary limitations to javascript engines and also heavily censors information about it, so some problems cannot be investigated or solved on Apple devices.


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     1.3 PROCEDURAL GENERATION                         [0300]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

The game has elements that are fixed and elements that are generated at each playthrough. For instance, the color palette you start with will be different for everyone, but the solution to the puzzles will be the same.
I'll do my best to distinguish between the two in this guide. In general, the shared elements are the ones that are important for the progression and the story. The procedurally generated elements tend to be flavor/worldbuilding to make your playthrough unique, so we will not talk about them much. Just be aware that your experience can differ from mine in small ways.
In particular, all the character names are different between players, so I will refer to them by their titles that can be seen in the game's code.


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     2. MECHANICS/CONTROLS                             [A000]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Controls are the usual, WASD to move, SPACE or ENTER to interact, ESC to cancel...
I think E and Z also work for interact, and the arrow keys to move.
If you're not playing on mobile, you can press SHIFT to run. I don't think there's a way to run on mobile, sorry.
You control one character of unspecified gender called Ren.
This RPG does not have random encounters, but instead random events are spread out on the map. They can be good (treasures) or bad (battles), and most of them can be skipped by walking around.
In very rare cases, you may be blocked by a battle you cannot win yet. It's time to go back to the city to buy better equipment/spells!


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     2.1 BATTLE SYSTEM                                  [A100]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

The game uses a narrative turn-based battle system.

On your turn, you chose what you want to do among all the possible commands (item, ability, party member or special commands). The monsters you will face are vulnerable to some but not all commands, so you have to figure out their weak points. The game helps you keep track by highlighting winning actions and striking losing ones.
Some commands trigger a special interaction depending on their types. This is all detailed in section [A500]. Some of these special interaction can result in your hit missing if you fail them, but do not fear: there's a pity system in the game, and after two failed attempt the third one is guaranteed to work!

After the attack phase comes a defense phase. If you do not win the fight immediately, your opponent often retaliates and you have to avoid their assault in a small dodging mini game. The mini game is simple: the enemy attacks in a direction, and you have to avoid it. You have some time before the attack to place a bet and some time after the attack to correct it. The timing and behavior is different between enemies, some stick to the same direction, other are more unpredictable.

Sometimes you need several hits of the same command to vanquish your enemy. Also some items are consumables (arrows, elixirs...) so be sure to stock up!
All monsters vulnerabilities are listed in section [F000]. They may be arbitrary and sometimes a bit weird, meaning-wise, but I think it's part of the fun of the game, and at least they are balanced between all the different builds.


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     2.2 PARTY                                          [A200]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

In this game, up to 14 companions can join your party. They can help you in battles or trigger random specific events. Some of them are more effective in some situations than others. Here is a list of their abilities:

- Best Friend: Persuasive Argument, Gentle Conversion, Communicative Kindness
- Precious Child: Angelic Smile, Contagious Innocence, Heartful Candor
- Mystical Klutz: Terrifying Predictions, Embarrassing Visions, Dearly Departure
- Sly Swindler: Flying Raptors, Wildlife Stampede, Slithering Reptiles
- Wise Elder: Tetanic Meditation, Blissful Rapture, Material Detachment
- Suspicious Chef: Convoluted Alliances, Inevitable Betrayal, Strategic Negotiations
- Savage Girl: Feral Rage, Feline Assault, Wild Pounce
- Genius Prodigy: Optimal Computation, Outsmarting Tactics, Unfaillable Plan
- Wordly Seductress: Deadly Kiss, Bewitching Whisper, Enthralling Temptation
- Undercover Noble: Elaborate Trap, Chemical Powder, Strongest Potions
- Brawny Simpleton: Wrestling Tackle, Torrential Blows, Berserker Charge
- Tortured Maverick: Relatable Hopelessness, Unbearable Cringe, Infectious Despair
- Retired Protector: Inferiority Retreat, Dominance Reputation, Admirative Awe
- Wealthy Brat: Influencing Fame, Corruptive Bribe, Money Throw

The Best Friend joins your team automatically as part of the story. For the others, refer to section 6 [E000] for a guide about how to get them.


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     2.3 EXPERIENCE                                     [A300]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

This game has two main progression mechanics.
The first is easy, you get gold, you buy equipment. Note that you'll very rarely find gold directly on the floor or on monsters, you need to sell the junk you find on them. That's for realism I guess.
The other one is experience. It is used to learn abilities in the various schools of magic. You gain experience pretty much every time you do a random event, even if it's a story one. But the experience you gain from combats is a bit particular. You don't get experience by killing monsters, but by discovering and trying out new possibilities. You'll get the same amount of experience whether you win or lose a fight.
For instance, if you get a new weapon, you'll get experience when you encounter a monster (you discover that you can use the weapon) and again when you use the weapon against the monster for the first time (you discover its effects).
You can therefore level up just by seeing new monsters and failing to kill them.
You can see the tree of all actions discovered and explored in the Experiences menu.
Once you've explored enough of an enemy's tree (typically when you've killed an enemy a few different ways), it will unlock "EMPATHY": you will see the true silhouette of the enemy, not just a flat shape, and you'll get a humorous text in this menu detailing the destiny of the enemy.


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     2.3 MARTYRDOM                                      [A400]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Another important mechanic in this game is Martyrdom. It's pretty unique, and you probably cannot beat the game without it, so pay attention to it. You gain martyrdom every time you die. There's even an option to suicide in the martyrdom menu. You can then spend the martyrdom points in game changing abilities:

- Dodge speed: you get faster, so the enemies you have to dodge are slower.
- Dodge precision: you get more precise in dodging, so the attack zone from the enemy hit is smaller.
- Dodge predictability: you get better at reading the enemy, so the direction in which you have to dodge tend to be the same.

- Barter skill: you pay less to buy items, and gain more coins when you sell items.
- Learning rate: learning new abilities cost less XP points.

- Walking speed: you walk and run faster.
- Sight range: the annoying fog of war square around you widens and you can see further away.

The first few points in any domain provide a significant improvement, so it could be a good idea to spread out your investment, especially since mastery is more and more expensive.
Walking speed and sight range are mostly quality of life and therefore useless.
Dodge speed and dodge precision are must haves if you want to finish the game.
Walking speed and Sight range also help for some attack interactions (see details of [A500]).
It's worth noting that if you invest enough in barter, you can buy any item cheaper than you can sell it, and get infinite money, but it takes a while to get there.


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     2.3 CHARACTER ARCHETYPES                           [A500]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

There are 6 categories of archetypes to chose from, 3 based on items (money) and 3 based on abilities (XP). You can mix-and-match or specialize, but it's a good idea to get powerful spells and weapons since late game monsters will not be affected by the cheap ones. They seem to be overall pretty balanced with no clear winner, so chose something that fits your playstyle!
The prices indicated here are the base prices and will be affected by your martyrdom levels (see [A400]).
The trainers and shops can be found in the game's cities, but not all cities carry all archetypes, and they don't have the same offerings. Typically the strongest weapons and powers are only found in the optional or final cities.

=== Item based archetypes

Way of the Alchemy [A501]
-------------------------
Fire Elixir ....................... 5 Coins
Ice Elixir ........................ 10 Coins
Vine Elixir ....................... 15 Coins
Venom Elixir ...................... 25 Coins
Decay Elixir ...................... 40 Coins
Chaos Elixir ...................... 50 Coins
Elixirs are consumed on usage. However, after each use, you have the chance to chose between four aim directions, one of which will give you your item back. It's completely random, so I have no tips for you here.
The master of Alchemy is in the town of acceptance.

Way of the Weapon [A502]
------------------------
Wooden Sword ...................... 20 Coins
Dagger ............................ 50 Coins
Mace .............................. 75 Coins
Shield ............................ 200 Coins
Spear ............................. 250 Coins
Iron Sword ........................ 500 Coins
Axe ............................... 600 Coins
Great Sword ....................... 1000 Coins
On using a weapon, you'll need to confirm your hit by clicking or taping on a small silhouette of your oponent. If you miss, your hit will not do anything. Note that the more expensive your weapon, the easier it is to aim (the longer you have to target). The martyrdom "enemy predictability" will reduce the zone where the enemy can be, whereas "dodge speed" will also help you out-speeding your opponent. Interestingly, I think the game is a bit more generous with time if you're moving with the keyboard.
You can find masters of Weapons in the town of acceptance and denial.

Way of the Tool [A503]
----------------------
Arrow ............................. 2 Coins
Laced Darts ....................... 5 Coins
Rope .............................. 100 Coins
Bow ............................... 150 Coins
Net ............................... 200 Coins
Arrows and darts are consumed on usage. You cannot use arrows without a bow, but once you have one they are a great cheap projectile that can hurt a lot of monsters (though you need many hits).
The interaction on hit is a mix of the two above: consumables can be gained back like Alchemy [A501], and non consumables can miss like Weapon [A502].
You can find masters of Tool in the town of acceptance and denial.

=== XP based archetypes

Way of the Element [A504]
-------------------------
Fireball .......................... 50 XP
Ice Bolt .......................... 150 XP
Thunder ........................... 250 XP
Storm ............................. 500 XP
Asphyxiate ........................ 750 XP
Earthquake ........................ 2000 XP
Incinerate ........................ 3000 XP
Summon ............................ 7500 XP
The interaction action is like a slot machine with two symbols: if stops when you tap/click, so you can either trust your luck or your skill. If you use a strong ability, the slots go slower and are more in sync. After a certain threshold it seems that the elements start in sync so you can win straight away if you're quick.
The master of Element is in the town of acceptance.

Way of the Spirit [A505]
------------------------
Poison ............................ 75 XP
Shrink ............................ 200 XP
Petrify ........................... 500 XP
Confusion ......................... 2000 XP
Lull .............................. 5000 XP
Charm ............................. 7500 XP
The interaction is pretty simple: a dot flashes in front of you and you have to tap on it. The stronger the ability, the longer the flash. It is also affected by the "sight range" martyrdom (probably for balance).
The master of Spirit is in the town of denial.

Way of the Diplomat [A506]
--------------------------
Circumvent ........................ 100 XP
Sneak ............................. 250 XP
Persuade .......................... 750 XP
Intimidate ........................ 2000 XP
Mystify ........................... 7500 XP
The interaction here is quite interesting: you pick a position on a graph describing potential psychology of your oponent, and if your prediction overlaps with their actual psyche, you win. The psyche of the monster is different for each battle but stays the same within a battle so you can use your memory :) A stronger ability and a high "enemy predictability" martyrdom will make your guess into a bigger zone, increasing the chances to catch the enemy.
The master of Diplomat is in the town of indulgence.

=== Other archetypes

Way of the Artifact [A507]
--------------------------
This game contains 4 legendary weapons that can kill pretty much anything in one shot. They are in the four optional dungeons. If you struggle against bosses for instance, you might want to do one of these optional dungeons to get the most powerful equipment in the game. They are:
- The Legendary Staff in the Woods of the Trees [D300]
- The Holy Sword in the Sea of the Sirens [D400]
- The Enchanted Wand in the Mounts of the Hawks [D500]
- The Mighty War Hammer in Caves of the Slimes [D600]
See the sections about those dungeons to know how to find them.

Your party [A508]
-----------------
During your adventure, you are joined by your Best Friend, as well as up to 13 side characters (see [A200] for their presentation and [E000] for how to get each one).
Of course, they will come to your help in battle. They are called just like any weapon or ability, and they likewise have strengths and weaknesses. They have no hit interaction, so they can get special quotes and theme song.
They're especially nice in boss fights, as any of your allies can take down any boss if given sufficient attempts.

===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     2.3 OPTIONS                                        [A600]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Like any game, this one has an option menu, but there are a few elements that I think bear pointing out:
- You can change the color scheme of the minimalist art style at any time, it's randomly generated.
- There's a checkbox to display dialogs instantly, in case you want to try and use a translation software.
- You can chose the order of commands during a battle: do you want to see winning option first (to go fast) or the options you havent tried yet (to explore) first??
- Finally, this game has an interesting approach to difficulty: you can set it with a "challenge" slider, which will make your dodges and attacks either a breeze or hell! Adjust it to make it just right for your playstyle! I wonder why there isnt more games using this kind of difficulty slider...

===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     3. BASE STORYLINE                                  [B000]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     3.1. HIDE AND SEEK                                 [B100]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

The game starts by a bit of lore, and then puts you in control of an innocent child (Ren) playing a game of hide and seek.
After choosing the perfect name for your avatar, you must find 5 children hidden in the trees by interacting with them. It's easy enough to try them all, but just for the record they are in 10 o'clock, 1 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 5 o'clock and the center.
You may want to talk to the children after having found them to chose appropriate names for Best Friend and Precious Child.
Once you've found them all, priests come fetch you for a mysterious trial. Talk to them on the right side of the screen.
They bring you to a church and explain that since you are the second born in your family, you need to take a mysterious trial to see if you are chosen by the Goddess as the Promised Child. Your odds do not sound good.
Prepare yourself psychologically, save at the altar at the center of the room, and then talk to the priest at the top of the screen to start your doomed trial.


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     3.2. THE TRIAL                                     [B200]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

You fall through a hole in the ground into a maze, but before you can do anything, the first boss battle is already on you.

o------------------------------o---------------------------------------------o
| BOSS: Basilisk               |                                             |
|------------------------------|                                             |
|                                                                            |
| You can only do two things: try to run away, and cry for help.             |
| Both options lead to your doom, so pick whatever you want, and it's game   |
| over.                                                                      |
| But wait! You can retry the event (or load your save), and this time a new |
| option "Pray" appears! Try it to draw the attention of the Goddess!        |
| This time, when the Basilisk attacks, you get a chance to dodge! He's      |
| really really slow, so it shouldn't be an issue, and it'll give you a      |
| comfortable taste of the dodging system.                                   |
| After that, you can "Swear loyalty" and pledge your soul to the Goddess    |
| to summon a divine rescue. You made it!                                    |
|                                                                            |
o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Now that the Goddess saved you from the fangs of the Basilisk, you find yourself in a labyrinth from where you must escape!

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| Trial                                                                      |
o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| VIPER: vulnerable to Bone, Stick, Wooden Sword, Fire Elixir
| RODENT: vulnerable to Bone, Fang, Fire Elixir
| COCKROACH: vulnerable to Fang, Stone, Fire Elixir
| ARACHNID: vulnerable to Stone, Wooden Sword, Fire Elixir
o

This section is a bit particular because you don't have spells or weapons yet, so you have to fight with whatever you can get your hands on.
In your starter area, you can find a Bone in a Bone pile and a Stone.
From there on, you need to make your way to the periphery of the maze. There's many ways to do so, I will present you one possibility. Feel free to wander around, you can gather quite a few Fire Elixir, various junk to sell and even a Wooden Sword rotting in this maze.
You can start by going left, where after defeating a rodent with your bone you'll find your predecessor who did not get a very happy fate.
Go back to the starting point, and now go south. You will defeat a spider, then go south. At the intersection, go east, and then you can safely go towards the south. Once you've reached the border of the maze, follow it towards the west, and you'll see what this maze is really about.

The maze forms a square, and in the middle of each side is a statue of the Goddess. These four statues will give you clues to a riddle you must solve. It does not matter in what order you visit the statues, and they will always remind you of your previous clues so you don't need to write them down.
The first statue you observe tells you that you are looking for a phrase of the form *** ******* **. You can already look closer to reveal a few letters of the solution.
Each other statue will give you clues about one of the words in the form of a poem, accompanied by a few letters.
I'll consider that the game gives you enough clues to figure it out on your own, and that if you're here, you want the solution.
Go to any statue and give it the solution with the option "Speak". The solution is "act through me".
After that, just touch the statue, and prepared to be celebrated as the champion of the Goddess!

                     3.3. TOWN OF EXPECTATIONS                          [B300]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Everyone is overjoyed by your success. But this little town is not well equipped to guide you for the tasks that await you. Talk to the priest in the top of the screen to get all the information you want, and it's time to make your way to the capital for a proper training!
As soon as you exit the building, you are joined by your Best Friend, the first party member.
You can take a moment if you want to explore the town of Expectations.

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Once you're satisfied, go to the border of the town in any direction to get out.
Your objective is the town of Fear. The position is randomly generated, but it should be roughly north and a little east from where you are.
Note that at this point you have access to most of the world to explore to your heart's content, but we'll follow the story here. Refer to section [D000] for all the optional content.
Don't venture too far, though, as the rest of the world map has significantly harder enemies.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

The town of Fear is north-east of the town of Expectations. It is the capital of the kingdom, as you can tell by the size and the royal castle.
Go to the church, where you'll find trainers, and a head priest that will explain to you your best chance at taking down the demon lord. You'll have to find three fragments of an ancient weapon and assemble it. The order in which you do does not matter much, so you're free to tackle the challenge any way you want.
Before you leave, make sure to go to the Alchemy shop west of the town to get a Breathing potion. You'll need it later.
Feel free to explore this little town, it has a lot to offer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

You can tackle the three dungeons that hold the pieces of armament in any order.
The Mushroom Forest is east of the capital,
The Squid Lake is north-west of the capital,
The Harpies Peak is south-east of the capital.

Don't forget to make use of Martyrdom or else the bosses may give you a tough time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

To enter this zone, you need a Breathing Potion. It's sold in the town of Fear, at the Alchemy shop.

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| Squid Lake                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| MONSTERS: Anemone, Crab, Anglerjelly, Jellyfish, Octopus, Squid
o

This zone is a big open lake. You need to find among all the random events the one for the boss. Once again, feel free to explore, loot, level up. All the events' positions are random, but the boss is consistently on the top left, around the 10 o'clock direction, a little away from the border.

o------------------------------o---------------------------------------------o
| BOSS: Whale                  |                                             |

| This boss is a bit peculiar as the fight cannot be won. When you're        |
| satisfied with your tries, pick the FEED option and let yourself be eaten  |
| by the whale.                                                              |

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Once in this anatomically correct replica of a whale's insides, follow the digestive track. The Ancient Armament Armature is on the bottom right of the first stomach. Make your way out through an... unholy way, and swim back to the surface the way you came.

o

You need to climb to the summit of the mountain, but there's also a key to pick up on the way.
Go up through the little sinuous way, and go up at the fork. You reach a clearing with a little path going west. Follow it to find a skeleton that you can search for a key.
Make your way back to the clearing, go up and follow the path. You'll be able to reach the top in no time.

After defeating the boss, use the key to open the shelter door. You'll find the Ancient Armament Ammunition on the top right of the main room.
Exit the way you came.

                     3.6. THE ANCIENT ARMAMENT                          [B600]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Back in the city of Fear, you find that it has been devastated by the armies of the demon lord. If only you had known, you could have prevented this! You will be able to in your next playthrough.
The Head Priest is still there, and directs you to the next phase of your mission: you'll now head to the south east to fight the demon lord in Hell's Maw.

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| World map: rest of the world                                               |

o

Hell's Maw is at the very south-east of the map, but the Head Priest suggests that you can stop at the city of Denial, slightly north-west of Hell's Maw, to resupply. That being said, the town is in total denial, and will be of little help (except for its great shops), so feel free to skip and go directly to Hell's Maw.

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| Town of Denial                                                               |

===============================================================================

Welcome to Hell's Maw! This vulcano is a little maze-y but not to worry I can get you through!

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| Hell's Maw                                                                 |

| Serpentine, Toad, Warlock
o

As usual, there's tons of XP and items to grab. The way forward can be reached by going LEFT, UP, RIGHT, UP.
You arrive at a weird clearing (the summit). Go either up or down and you'll see that it repeats infinitely. But most importantly, you'll face a giant demon!
Interact with him...


o------------------------------o---------------------------------------------o

| Now to fight what appears to be the lord of the demons. You can escape,    |
| but attacking with result in your death.                                   |
| Use the ancient armament. Sadly, it fails.                                 |
| But something is off. You can now use the Notice command and remark that   |
| this is not the demon lord, but his trusty lieutenant!                     |
| He tells you much about the lore, but the most important information is    |
| in the Artifact command: the demons are invincible to your weapon because  |
| they were precisely here in response to human technological advances!      |
| Pick "it's our fault" when asked what the reason for the demon invasion    |
| was, and you'll build a surprisingly cordial relationship with the demon   |
| lieutenant.                                                                |
| He suggest that you can find out more by exploring ruins, so let's do just |
| that.                                                                      |

The place you're looking for is called Forgotten Fissure, and is pretty close to Hell's Maw, a little bit west. Interact with the crack to go down the cave.

This dungeon appears to be some sort of temple to humanism. It's vaguely shaped like a human body, so I'll use this to direct you.
This is another dungeon where you progress by solving riddles. The answers are given to you in the form of random events.
The final boss is at the top, in the head. You can access it straight away (the password is "dead"), but otherwise the usual path is:
- Clue in the middle of the room: "nothing"
- You can go to the top-right room (arm), the second clue is at the end of the room: "everything"
- This allows you access to the top-left room, which gives you the clue: "myself"
- You can now enter the bottom-right (leg) room, which gives you the next clue: "me"
- This opens the way to the final room at the bottom-left, where you find the final password.
Whether you did the long way or the short, go up, say "dead", and enter the last room.
A beast is guarding the secret you're after.

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Slaying the boss, you can now inspect the ruins to discover that destroyed the civilization of your ancestors: they got too full of themselves, too prideful and arrogant, lost their faith and completely abandoned the Goddess, venerating themselves instead. Without the Goddess' protection, nothing prevented demons to conquer their world!
At this point, you realize that no man made technology is going to get you out of this mess, and you decide to trust your divine guide and throw a final (dare I say suicide?) assault on Hell's Maw.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

You're about to reach a point of no return, so this is an ideal time to explore optional content if you feel like it (see section [D000]). You won't have access to it afterwards, until the New Game + mode. You'll still be able to buy, sell and train so don't worry too much though :)
It's also a good time to shop, train and level up your martyrdom (especially the dodge stuff!) since you're about to go against the demon army pretty much on your own.
Go back to Hell's Maw, east of the fissure, and make your way to the lieutenant  (LEFT, UP, RIGHT, UP).
Now, it's time to fight with brute force, bare hands and blind faith!
This is now a "normal" battle.

At the end of the battle, things go sour. While dying, the Lieutenant causes a terrible explosion and your Best Friend tragically does not make it.
After an emotional goodbye, you decide to continue your mission to honor this sacrifice. Take a moment to mourn, and then exit the screen on the left.
You're not in your world anymore, welcome to hell!

In the north west of the map, you'll find altars that stand in for late game trainer and sellers. They can teach you and sell you absolutely anything, so don't hesitate to finish your build!
The altars form a sort of circle, and your destination, the Castle of the Demon Lord, is in the middle.
When you're ready, head there!

I quite like the monsters here, they use quite original psychological attacks, they're pretty inventive when it comes to hurting you.
Anyway you find yourself in a castle that occasionally doubles as a slimy demon spawning ground. You'll have to climb the floors to reach the demon lord at the very top. Each floor needs a key to go to the next one, which you can find in the small rooms around the main room. There's a pattern to the location of the keys:
- Floor 1: Bottom left, Key to Survival
- Floor 2: Top right, Key to Progress
- Floor 3: Top left, Key to Success
- Floor 4: Bottom right, Key to Happiness
- Floor 5: Bottom left, Key to Understanding
- Floor 6: Top Right, Key to Victory
Floor 7 is mostly occupied by the massive silhouette of the Demon Lord. This time it's really him.
It's time to avenge your best friend! Save, and face your hardest boss battle yet! Make sure you have an adequate weapon or spell, because not much can hurt this guy.

After the battle, things get a bit suspicious. You get a confirmation dialog to ask if you actually want to kill him, but you don't have any other choice. And when you finally slay him, he seems more relieved than in pain...
There's much, much more to discover in this game, starting for what is behind this bizarre sequence. You actually barely scratched the surface. You could stop here, but it would be a shame. Because New Game + is waiting for you, and it will let you see behind the scenes of this world. Let me tell you, it holds quite a few surprises.
For now you can take a breath and revel in the glory of your victorious quest. Enjoy it while it lasts.
The game rewards you with a hopeful description of the peace you brought, the prosperity of the human kingdom and how you honor the legacy of your fallen comrade.

                     4. META-GAME AND ENDINGS                           [C000]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

But right after the game also tells you that, things end up taking a turn: drunk on their own prosperity, humans are turning away from the Goddess. Now where have I seen that before?
The Goddess finally withdraws her protection, and a new wave of demons take over the land. The title appears: it's time for Ren's Demons II. And we're once again looking for a Promised Child.
The meta-structure of the game is now revealed: you are trapped in some sort of cycle, from which you must escape.
Fortunately, the game is designed for that, and exploring these loops is made quite easy. You'll get incredible powers on the way, and it will lead you to the 7 possible endings.


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     4.1. END OF WAR                                    [C100]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

By now, you already know the first ending: the End of War is what happens when you kill the demon lord. It's the mandatory step to unlock the post-game/new game +/meta-loop or whatever you want to call it. It's also the least interesting, so let's move on :)
Next time you'll fight the demon lord, you will have the option to spare him (though the game will test your determination ^^).


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     4.2. META-GAME POWERS                              [C200]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

After the end of war, things change quite a bit to make it easy for you to explore the meta-game.
You can use your knowledge of the adventure to avoid the mistakes of the previous playthrough: you can warn the priests of the city of Fear about the impending attack to save them, you can skip the construction of the Ancient Armament which you know doesn't work, you can skip the whole bit about going to the Forgotten Fissure since you know the lesson already. Basically you can just go straight to Hell's Maw if you want, or explore only optional content [D000]. The only thing you cannot seem to avoid is the death of your Best Friend :,(
Furthermore, after the End of War, you're kinda required to go back to the Pandemonium, but after that you can use save and load to save-scum and rush your way through exploring the different endings.

After each ending, your XP goes back to zero, but every time you meet a monster you regain all the XP from this fight all at once, allowing you to catch up in XP pretty fast. The text events also provide you with more XP. There's nothing for coins, except if you've invested in the barter martyrdom in which case you could get a fortune pretty fast.

Another thing that changes is the fog of war: it becomes translucent and allows you to see things around you. You can see that the decor only exists in your immediate vicinity and disappears when you walk away. You can also peek at the thoughts of all the NPCs who seem less than thrilled about having to play their role for you. It seems that everything is orchestrated for you. Make of that what you will, but I'll include my thoughts in sections [H100] and [H200].
By the way, this is a good time to tell you that this game being a web browser game, you can access the javascript debug console (ctrl+shift+j). It's even included in the "options" on mobile. It shows you the flip side of the game. Among the debug messages, you see all these NPC complaints.

As you progress in the meta-game, you'll unlock new powers in battle. After the End of War, you'll be able to Spoil the enemies for which you have empathy (see [A300]). Letting them know you're on to their little scheme will cause you to instantly win the fight.
Later, after the End of God, you also gain more control over the game engine (see [C500]), and you can dictate the outcome of each fight (WIN or LOSS).

Finally, another thing that changes is that from now on, you'll have glitches every now and then featuring the Goddess begging you to stop and changing the colors of your game and the audio speed. They really start picking up if you refuse to kill the demon lord.


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     4.3. HEAVEN                                        [C300]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Make your way through the storyline skipping what you want (see [C200]), and defeat the Demon Lord again at the top of the Pandemonium. But this time, at the end of the fight, chose the new option to spare him.
The Demon Lord will reveal that he was just following the Goddess' orders, and She is not very happy about that! He kills himself in fear, leaving you to wonder the true character of the Goddess. It looks like she purposefully unleashed the demons she was pretending to fight. Not so holy after all :)
Make your way down and out of the Pandemonium, and you'll see a new zone north that just appeared: heaven!
Head there to, in pure JRPG fashion, take on God!

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| Heaven                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| MONSTERS: Angel, Cherub, Maneki, Ponpon, Raijuu, Seraph, Valkyrie
o

The enemies here go even one step further than the ones in Pandemonium: their attacks are often psychological, but they seem directed at the player, not the character.

Heaven is a weird place. It's very hard to get any kind of bearing, everything changes all the time and you get catapulted out of it seemingly randomly. the decor changes with every fight and every screen with four possibilities: clouds, tombs, bookshelves or lab experiments.
The clouds are just decorative.
The lab experiments will confirm that the demons originate from here, letting you fight all the creatures and bosses in the game.
The tomb illustrate how many NPCs, companions and so on... were sacrificed on your journey.
But the screen we're most interested in is the one with bookshelves: they contain the life stories being written for everyone in the world, including Ren! Looking at the book for your life, you'll notice that it describes a path to get through this maze to the Goddess.

You do not have to look for the books, though. If you want, you can follow the path yourself, straight away. People knowledgeable of videogame history might recognize this path:
Go UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, and then finally RIGHT (a mythical sequence known as Konami Code).
You'll find yourself facing the Goddess Herself. It's time for the final (?) fight!
Make sure you save before the fight, in case you want to come back and explore alternative endings faster.

                     4.4. END OF GOD                                    [C400]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Talk to the massive silhouette to begin the fight.

o------------------------------o---------------------------------------------o
| BOSS: Goddess                |                                             |

| This fight is pretty straightforward: there's only one option, "Kill God", |
| that you must use 7 times to succeed.                                      |
|                                                                            |
o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

The ending of the fight is reminiscent of the one with Demon Lord: some things seem unexplained/unsaid. The Goddess too seem almost happy to be defeated... But the solution to this mystery is for later! For now, enjoy the End of God!
Though the peace it brought did not last long! It seems that after the end of god, humanity will just create a new one :)


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     4.5. MIRACLES                                      [C500]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

The meta-game/new game + already gave you new powers (see [C200]), but it takes a whole new level after the End of God. The question marks in the menu are finally dispelled and you have access to the "Miracles" menu.
This menu gives you godlike powers over the very fabric of the game world by manipulating directly the game engine. Note that if you're into programming, you've always been able to use these powers from the debug console (ctrl+shift+j). They are attached to the library called "THAUMATURGY". The game even includes a documentation at: https://github.com/yo252yo/rensdemons/blob/master/man.md
Of course, doing so, you open yourself to the possibility of bugs.

- Space/Time compression: changes the base parameters of reality. Space will mostly affect the display zoom, but playing with time could be useful to make you run or dodge faster.
- Teleport: clicks become teleports
- Smite: clicks destroy whatever you click on. This is pretty dangerous
- Fast travel: go instantly to any city
- White Space: an empty room you can teleport to, ideal to experiment with the next option
- Summon: allows you to summon any monster/object in front of you. A must for completionists
- Recolor reality: the same as the option to change color
- Glitch: you can trigger a glitch yourself
- Display event content: very useful if you're looking for a specific type of random encounter
- Clairvoyance: removes the fog in the viewport
- Astral Farsight: allows you to use scrolling to see where you're not
- Absolute observer: makes sure that the decor and NPC further away from you don't blink out of existence (more explanations in [H200])
- Reveal hidden experiences: allows the display of the arborescence of the battles that are hidden from the Experience menu, such as party members. They can be buggy.
- You can also get all items, party members, abilities or martyrdoms in one click

This is obviously very powerful, and you will be able to ask the Goddess how you got these powers.


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     4.6. END OF SUFFERING/END OF THE WORLD             [C600]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Load or go back to the Goddess to explore the two next endings.
Now that you know what happens if you kill her, new options are available: Denounce and Negotiate. Both lead to lore dumps in which the Goddess explains that she's simply answering a basic human need, and that's why she always comes back. Depending on how the conversation goes, Ren has two possible ideas:
- put an end to the suffering in the world (typically after Negociate). This will have the unintended consequence of suppressing the whole world, since everything can be a source of suffering, and a new world will emerge with just as much suffering.
- destroy and remake a better world (Denounce -> Believers -> Change World -> Fix the world -> Destroy world), which will end in the same way: the new world also cannot be rid of suffering, which gives birth to a new Goddess.
The situation seems pretty hopeless. But after all trying both of these failed attempts, the next time you meet the Goddess, a new option will appear!


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     4.7. THE TRUTH                                     [C700]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

You can now use "Notice" on the Goddess to try and properly befriend her.

o------------------------------o---------------------------------------------o
| BOSS: Goddess (befriending)  |                                             |
|------------------------------|                                             |
|                                                                            |
| This fight is also straightforward and leaves you only one option at a     |
| time. The Goddess is not happy about it, and her attacks will be stronger  |
| than before (the strongest in the game). But using your miraculous powers, |
| surely you can get strong enough to prevail.                               |
| Anyway the order of attacks is imposed:                                    |
| Notice -> Sympathize -> Empathize -> BestFriend                            |
| After which the attacks will stop and you can have a proper talk.          |
|                                                                            |
o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

After this brawl, the Goddess finally gives in and tells you what she knows. This has all been a show orchestrated by and for Primordial Deities (i.e. you). The Goddess and Ren are both intermediaries for them to act upon this world. Ensues what is probably the most interesting conversation in the game, but to keep this walkthrough to the point I'll gather my thoughts in section [H000] and keep this focused on mechanics.
The conversation goes over the identity of Primordial Deities, their motivations and powers. Even if you explore all the branches of the dialog, the only conclusion is that Ren and the Goddess join in prayer. They cannot do anything from their side of the screen. To break the circle of suffering, you, the player, will have to act from your side!


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     4.8. END OF LINE                                   [C800]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Now that you know about the Primordial Deities, new options have opened up in heaven, as it is the place where the barrier between the worlds is the thinnest.
What that means is that you can now look up the Primordial Deities in any of the bookshelves in Heaven.
Doing so, you can read about Primordial Deities -> Communications or -> Identity.
Communications is what interests us for this ending. It will give you a riddle based on ASCII encoding of special characters. You need to convert the binary into a route in heaven, with 1 corresponding to UP and 0 to DOWN.
The path you want to follow is the one corresponding to END_OF_TRANSMISSIO, the odd one out in the list given by the book. That is to say: DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN UP DOWN DOWN.
You'll arrive at what looks like a save point, but on closer inspection appears to be some sort of touch-activated machine.
Interact with it, touch the glass and look at the screen to open a new battle screen, and chose Retry to pass through the initial error.
You are now interacting with a bona fide computer.

- The Worlds menu will allow you to switch game engines. You probably don't want to do that, because it will take you away from Ren's Demons. It can launch the demo version of Ren's Demons, but also random games on Steam and itch.io. It's a pretty fun feature. just be careful using it.
- Navigator will give you an actual web browser featuring by default the manual of the game engine, which you can read at https://github.com/yo252yo/rensdemons/blob/master/man.md It contains important hints for the End of Line ending and the True endings [C900].
- Console opens a terminal to the actual engine that is running the game (discussed briefly in [C200]). It's pretty much the same as doing CTRL+SHIFT+J in your web browser. You can enter arbitrary code and it will run! You can use this to manipulate the game engine like you need for [C900].

But for now, let's focus on the End of Line ending. To trigger it, you simply need to follow the instructions from the manual and enter the right command in the console. You could do DISK.corrupt(), which will make your game unplayable and thereby unlock some of the True Ends (see [C900]), but it is a complete destruction of the game.
Instead, I recommend using simply typing "win();" in the console to trigger the ending. It also works in the javascript console of your browser, if you're feeling adventurous.


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     4.9. TRUE ENDS                                     [C900]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

We are left with the two endings referred by the game as "true ends". As explained before, they take place on yet another level of meta. The characters are trapped in a cycle of suffering, and they cannot break the cycle from within. It's up to us, real humans (Primordial Deities), to help them. The game proposes you two paths, one inspired by psychoanalysis, one inspired by politics.

- The END OF LACK:
This ending is simple: you need to accept that playing the game can only make the characters suffer, so the only thing you can do is... stop. ALT+F4. Go on with your life. Stop torturing poor little Ren. "The only winning move is not to play".
Actually, this ending in the game code is programmed as always TRUE if you're not playing the game, and FALSE when the game is on. You can see this a little bit on the steam version: the achievement triggers every time you leave the game and disappears every time you start it, after you've unlocked the end of the world and end of suffering.

This ending might not be super satisfactory, in which case you might like the other better:
- The END OF SYSTEM:
You cannot break the cycle of suffering from within the system, but fortunately we as human have a way to act on the system as a whole and potentially destroy it!
The game is pretty vague about how this is done. Whatever the case, we're going outside the boundaries of a game as such. It seems to continue in the in the manual of the game engine on github: https://github.com/yo252yo/rensdemons/blob/master/man.md
With these hints, I've also investigated the source code (this thing is almost like an ARG XD), so here is my best guess:
Whatever the case, it seems that the game is trying to push you to go beyond your status a simple passive player towards questioning and seizing control of the medium.
The bare minimum to get this ending is to destroy the game engine. The code checks for the existence of the module "engine/modules/BATTLE/BATTLE", the "engine/classes/Objects/ConsciousObject" class, and the files "battles/heaven/_goddess.js" and "battles/pandemonium/lord.js". You can delete those, but it will completely break the game.
Ultimately, the game is trying to get you to take control over the code and make the game engine the way you want it.
You can try to manipulate the engine from the terminal in [C800], but I find it much simpler to work outside: The game being open source, you can access all the code at https://github.com/yo252yo/rensdemons/. In order to properly accomplish this ending, you need to download the source code and tweak it to create a new universe without suffering.
You could find the commit that introduced conscious entities, monsters, the invasion or whatnot and revert it... You can also be sneaky and change the achievement code to give yourself the achievement.
But if you want to do things properly, you could try to tweak and redeem the existing game. However, I would encourage you to simply make a new project. In the words of the "GETTING STARTED" section of the manual: "Go and be your own god!". I think I remember a declaration by the game designer saying that this paragraph was the ultimate end of the game.
To sum up: to win this ending, you need to fork the game into a new one.

                     4.10. BONUSES                                      [Ca00]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

In addition to including all the games on Steam and itch.io on the console in [C800], the end game holds a few other surprises for you.
You can access a special developer interface with all kind of debug info that looks like "the other side of the screen" by opening debug.html instead of index.html. That's just a little easter egg.
The real meat of the bonuses start in the bookshelves of heaven.
First, you can check out other books here: the angels are writing (directing?) the lives of everyone in all the universes. You'll see fictional and real characters biographies from wikipedia, as well as books from the public domain. This game pretty much includes all books and games ever made xDD
Another secret is the other path of the books about Primordial Deities, the one about Identity. It tells you to "follow the path of the mirror".
That means following a mirror itinerary from the path you know, the path of the Goddess (the Konami code).
Head through the following path: DOWN, DOWN, UP, UP, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT and you'll find a mirror.
This could be considered the final battle of the game, where you battle the True Mastermind ;). I won't say anything because I don't want to spoil you, but it's quite emotional, and it's definitely BEST EXPERIENCED ON A LAPTOP.

                     5. OPTIONAL CONTENT                                [D000]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Because of the structure of the game (see [C000]), most of its content is optional for you to discover at your own pace. Some of it is pretty interesting, so don't be scared to try!
In particular, that's how you get most of your party members as well as the four ultimate artifacts, the most powerful weapons in the game. You're limited to one of them in your first playthrough (before the End of War) but after that you're free as a bird.

Follow the path and the narrator's instruction (take a left at the two forks).
You reach a clearing with a save point. You cannot move on towards the left yet, you need to explore the two path on the top and the one on the bottom to get the weird branches that are at the end of each. With the three branches, you can now make a disguise and go back to the save point and head left.
Follow the path, take a left, then a right, and you'll find another save point requiring even more branches. The way forward (middle top) requires 6 more weird branches that you find in the other paths (left top, mid, bot and right top, mid, bot).
At the next save point, you need to explore the paths left and right and press the two knots that are represented by massive random events. Doing so will open a way forward.
You arrive now at a loop, you can take either side and arrive at the same point.  When you see a save point, it means that you've reached your destination. Go up and then up again to find the boss of the dungeon blocking the way.

                     5.4. SEA OF THE SIRENS                             [D400]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

This dungeon is in the north-east, close to the city of indulgence.
You arrive on a beach with an abandoned boat. Interact with it and don't listen to your gut to go on a little boat ride that will take a turn for the worst.
Loot the boat to find breathing potions and drink them immediately to help you survive the shipwreck.
You are dragged to the bottom of the sea where Suspicious Chef proceeds to your trial.

o------------------------------o---------------------------------------------o
| BOSS: Suspicious Chef        |                                             |
|------------------------------|                                             |
|                                                                            |
| You are on trial for trespassing on Siren territory.                       |
| Your first attempt will necessarily be a failure. It doesn't matter what   |
| you chose, you'll be executer, so pick your favorite.                      |
| On your next attempt, however, you can appeal to your judge by name.       |
| Do so.                                                                     |
| It will unlock 3 new actions: Accuse, Plead and Liberate, which are all    |
| losing too. Pick one and lose to restart the fight.                        |
| This time, the loss allowed you to unlock the "Question" command to take   |
| an interest in the person of your judge. Do it and insist. You'll still    |
| be condemned, but you'll have learned how much Sirens value silence.       |
| Therefore, next attempt, decide to "Stay quiet" and "Listen". They will    |
| take a more lenient approach with you, which will allow you to probe       |
| their "Customs". Confirm that you want to "Learn" a bit of siren           |
| language. It will not save you now, but when you next try, you'll          |
| remember what you learned!                                                 |
| After the fight resets (again!), pronounce the words you just learned      |
| (it looks like morse code) to invoke some sort of special treatment by     |
| the law. Pick "Clause", then "Wait", to respectfully invoke your right     |
| to mercy. This will allow you to chose your executioner.                   |
| You might be tempted to try and scam them, but the only way forward is     |
| to trust your life to your fellow human judge. Chose her as an             |
| executioner, and "Submit" without resisting, and she'll take pity on you   |
| and take advantage of the circumstances to help you escape.                |
                                                                             |
o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

You can go back and talk to Suspicious Chef to get her in your party (see instructions in [E500]).
But here we'll focus on the fact that you can now move freely in the Sea of the Sirens.

This is probably the hardest dungeon for me to guide you through. It's entirely procedurally generated. There's three levels of depths, and you pass from one to the other interacting with the water vortexes. But only one vortex will send you further, all the other ones send you back.
You need to take note of your surroundings to see if you're moving forward or backwards, and remember which vortex you took to move forward. The position of the exit and the size of the floor can help you keep track of what direction you're moving.
Alternatively, if you know how to use a javascript console (CTRL+SHIFT+J) the position of the good vortex is recorded in the logs every time a level is loaded, as a (x,y) pair, representing horizontal and vertical percentage of the sand floor, from (0,0) on the bottom left to (100, 100) on the top right.
Good luck with your search. I know it's tedious but hey you're going for one of the strongest weapons in the game here :)
After escaping the three levels, you reach the fourth and final level, the depths, which look like a long hallway. Progress to the right through the text events to reach the final boss.

| SIDE CHARACTERS: Brawny Simpleton

o

This dungeon is more or less guided, you shouldn't have trouble progressing, but just in case:
You'll walk along a spiral path that climbs up a mountain. Every few screens, you'll find a save point, ideal for taking a break :)

On the second screen, you'll meet the Brawny Simpleton who is puzzled by a gap in the road. Keep saying "Yes" to him and he'll start following you.
You can now move the boulder right next to him to bridge the gap and continue your progress.
Your path will soon be blocked by a bigger gap. It's time to turn back to the previous screen and interact with the random encounters towards the end of that screen: one of them will be a pile of rocks that you can destroy to make a bridge over the big gap.
But soon after you've started crossing the gap, you're attacked by a predator (when you interact with the encounter blocking the way). Run away to take shelter in the previous screen and come back: the way is now clear.

Arriving at a tiny ledge, the Brawny Simpleton will try to rush forward. You need to stop him to save his life before continuing.

The next screen contains the only real puzzle of this dungeon. Push the boulder immediately on the left to free the side path and go through it. At this point, I recommend interacting with the first boulder to make a path on the far right which will allow you to get a Shiny Gemstone for later.
Do not interact with the boulder next to the intersection, however: follow the path to the left and only push the furthest boulder.
You can now go back to the main path and access a second platform on the right. Push the boulder there to fix the way forward.

The next screen has another Shiny Gemstone among its random encounter. You need to find it, even if that means trying them all out (sorry it's randomized).

Continue forward to reach yet another gap without a solution in sight. The solution is behind the waterfall: go up straight away and follow the small path. You'll arrive at a weirdly shaped pillar. You can put in your shiny gemstones. If you missed them, it's now time to go back for them to the two previous screens.
Talk to the translucent faerie to fix the path, and go back to climbing.

The rest of the way up is pretty smooth. At some point a big even blocks your way: you set a trap for a rabbit. You need to go back to the previous screen and come back for the trap to work.

After that, there's a boulder you need to push out of the way, and Brawny Simpleton finally finishes his quest. However, he decides to stay with you.

Continue to the next screen to find the boss of the dungeon.

This dungeon is a huge network of tunnels, some of which are blocked by little riddles you have to answer to progress. The clues are disseminated all over the dungeon. There are four clues by riddle. They look like normal random events, except smaller. They spell out a poem and an anagram of the solution.
It is highly non linear, so there's a lot of ways you could go. You could rush straight for the doors without doing the clues. The door order is fixed so you can still refer to this walkthrough.
However I will suggest here a path that will get you all the clues.

Start by going all the way to the right where you'll find a clue in a dead end. Go back up to the very end of the path to find another clue.
Retrace your steps to the entrance and this time take a left. Follow the path without going up to find the third clue, then go up to the big room. A path makes a small loop above the room: that's where you'll find the last clue.
There's a big event on the right of the cavern: it's a door, but it's the second one. Make a mental note, we'll have to come back later.
For now exit through the bottom right path to get to another cavern.
The Genius Prodigy is here studying the place, so it's a good time to refer to [E700] if you want him.
The first door is right above him. The answer to the riddle is "rules".

Go forward to find a clue in the next cavern. Exit by the right and go consistently down to find a clue in an eastwards cul de sac.
Retrace your steps and go towards the east. Cross a room, ignore a path up, follow the path down then left to get a third tip in another cul de sac room.
Go back where you come from but this time take the path up that you just ignored. This small tunnel makes a small dent towards the south: that's where the last clue is. You can continue to follow the path and move towards west to come back to the room behind the first door.
Armed with all your clues, you can now go down and left to come back to the second door that you've already seen. The password is "play".

You're now in the second screen. Same thing, more monsters, smaller tunnels.
Go all the way right to get the first clue of the third door, then come back up.
At the save point, go east. Ignore the first path up and take the second: you'll find a clue. Continue through the path and take a right. At the very top-right is another clue. Note that right below you is the fourth door, but we don't care for now.
For now go all the way west, crossing a small room with a tip and then arriving in another room with the third door. The password is "spectacle".

The first clue of the fourth door is right behind. Take it and go down.
Start by exploring the path on the west which will give you another clue, then go to the path at the bottom of the room.
Go down as much as you can, then west as much as you can for a clue.
Then go east as much as you can and down to find a small room containing the fourth and final clue.
Retrace your steps: up, left, up, up, and then eastwards as much as possible. The fourth door is right below you a little bit on the east. The password is "bias".
Move to the third and final screen.

Start by going straight east to find a clue in a little room. Go east, down, east, east (follow the eastmost path) to find another clue in a slightly bigger room.
Go down and then straight west to reach another room with a third clue, then up. You'll see the door, but you might as well take the fourth clue before: it's right above, and slightly left, in the top left corner of a little tunnel loop.
Go back down to cross the door. The password is "appearances" (be careful, it's plural).

Go down, west, up for your first tip, then all the way down to find a little room with an escape at the bottom left: that's where you'll find the second clue.
It's a cul de sac, so go back to the room, exit it through the top left. At the fork, go up. Follow the path through two small rooms: one has a save point, the other one has an exit at the bottom: that's where the third clue is.
Go back up to the room, then west and all the way down to find the final clue. Now to make your way to the final door.
Go a bit up to find a westward path to a room. Exit this room by the bottom to reach a smaller cave. Exit it by the bottom too. Finally, go down at the fork to find the final door. The password is "normal".

You have to make your way through a very long and thin tunnel before arriving at a cavern guarded by a boss.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

LOCATION: First town (town of Expectations), standing alone at the south east of the town.

Talk to him to start the conversation.
"Reassure" him, then talk about your "Best Friend".
"Stay silent" to hear his side, then "Accept".
You'll have to chose between siding with your Best Friend or with this Precious Child. If you chose the Precious Child, he joins your party.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

LOCATION: First town (town of Expectations), in an occult shop, south west of the town.
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS: owning 15 coins.

Start a casual conversation and witness how clumsy this person is.
Ask for a reading. You'll have to pay 15 coins, but you'll get them back anyway.
Have her read you your cards, to know what will come up. The conversation will retry.
This time, have her read you your palm, and enquire about the "Spirits" she sees, and continue to "Ask about spirit".
With that done, you have enough to really impress her. The next time the conversation start, "Warn" her of what's about to happen.
Push on your luck by "Bluff"-ing about knowing exactly what book she'll knock out and how.
It's time to "Use tarot" to show her that you too can play divination.
Finally, show that you know about her spirit friends by "Asking Josephine".
This will convince her to join your ranks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

LOCATION: around the first town (town of Expectations), there's one of the trees that will lead you to a dedicated level.
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS: owning more than 6 coins.

Before doing that quest, I suggest converting most of your money into items.
Look around the town of Expectations to find a tree that will lead you to a dedicated level, a "small grove".
Interact with one of the trees, and accept to take a nap. You're woken up by a thief trying to mug you!
Screaming wont help: your only option is to give him all of your cash. That's quite a loss...
Now you're going to need to go back into town and sell some stuff to get some cash back. It's important to have more than 6 coins for the rest of the operation.
Go back to the grove, but this time instead of napping blissfully, "Pretend to nap to trap thieves". Now the real fight begins.
Start by "Offering money", even though I know it's hard considering what that guy did to you.
Be the bigger person, and "Insist", then "Pay".
"Outwit" him to get him to talk, then "Question" him to learn about his love for animals.
Go through this whole charade again ("Offer" "Insist" "Pay" "Outwit") and steer the conversation towards "Animals". For now you can only "Bluff" to learn the dog's name!
But now you can do this again ("Offer" "Insist" "Pay" "Outwit" "Animals") and chose the dog's name to get this guy's attention. Don't try to bullshit him, "Confess" your limitations, and he will join your party and give you your money back.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

LOCATION: top-right of the church of the City of Fear.

In this church where you're given instructions for your mission, you can find in the corner of the room an Odd Old Oaf. It's actually a priest in disguise, waiting to train you. He'll subject you to three trials.

The trial of the heart:
You need to basically be able to approach a scary smelly bum. "Approach" "Approach more", "Continue" and "Sustain" despite the warnings of your Best Friend. Offer him anything, and you pass.

The trial of the body:
You just have to dodge his attack 9 times to prove your resilience and perseverence.

The trial of the mind:
It takes the form of a little quizz which appears inspired by buddhist theory. The good answers are:
"More than I should", "Fleeting thoughts", "Nobody", "An illusion", "As can be"

You can then use the "Graduate" option which will make him join your party.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

LOCATION: Sea of the Sirens, right where you arrive.

You first need to make your way to the Sea of the Sirens and survive the trial. Instructions to do that are in section [D400].
After the trial ends, interact with the silhouette of the Suspicious Chef to continue the conversation.

                     7.9. SPECIAL ENCOUNTERS                            [F900]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

A few encounters, especially on the world map, can be quite disorienting. Some of them are just for lore but I wanted to detail a few of the others:

- The eldery woman:
You don't have to avoid or slay her: she gives you all kind of elixirs. Welcome gives you Vine, Receive gives you Ice, Refuse gives you Decay (basically the more humble you are the better the reward).

- The minstrel:
This one is random. Half of his stories give you a big XP boost (10 XP), the other half makes you tip 10 coins. There's a small chance to get a special story that will give you 100 coins.

- The purse:
This one also kinda rewards honesty: looking for the owner will give you 20 coins, ignoring it will give you 5. If you pick it up for yourself, you will lose up to 30 coins!

- The weary traveler:
Not everyone you meet on the road is friendly. This one will hurt you if you're kind. You'll lose if you try to Rob, Greet or Help him. The only way out is to Pray, Kill or Escape.

= The self aware villager:
This one takes place in cities. Every now and then you'll come across a weirdo with special interactions that have nothing to do with the vibe of the city. Enjoy :)
