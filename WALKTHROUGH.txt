                     1. INTRODUCTION                                   [0000]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

This is a guide to the game Ren's Demons by yo252yo. This is my first time writing a walkthrough, I hope I'll do good enough of a job to help those who need it.
I wanted to write a guide for this little indie game because I felt that it was a pretty interesting project, but parts of it are pretty challenging. The ending, in particular, can be tricky to understand. With this guide, I hope that I can share my passion for this game, and make it accessible to everyone!
I'll try to keep the spoilers to a minimum and properly tag them, but this is a text file describing all the contents of the game, so you'll have to do your part too ^^


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     1.1 ABOUT THE GAME                                [0100]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Ren's Demons is definitely a weird game. It's a web browser game (if you got it anywhere else, know that what you're getting is actually a web browser) that is kind of a mix between a traditional JRPG, a text-based adventure game (chose your own adventure) or a visual novel, maybe.


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     1.2 TROUBLESHOOTING                               [0200]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

If you're having problems running the game, try another web browser, operating system or device. The game is written in HTML and javascript, so any web browser should do the trick. Apple enforces arbitrary limitations to javascript engines and also heavily censors information about it, so some problems cannot be investigated or solved on Apple devices.


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     1.3 PROCEDURAL GENERATION                         [0300]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

The game has elements that are fixed and elements that are generated at each playthrough. For instance, the color palette you start with will be different for everyone, but the solution to the puzzles will be the same.
I'll do my best to distinguish between the two in this guide. In general, the shared elements are the ones that are important for the progression and the story. The procedurally generated elements tend to be flavor/worldbuilding to make your playthrough unique, so we will not talk about them much. Just be aware that your experience can differ from mine in small ways.
In particular, all the character names are different between players, so I will refer to them by their titles that can be seen in the game's code.


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     2. MECHANICS/CONTROLS                             [A000]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Controls are the usual, WASD to move, SPACE or ENTER to interact, ESC to cancel...
I think E and Z also work for interact, and the arrow keys to move.
If you're not playing on mobile, you can press SHIFT to run. I don't think there's a way to run on mobile, sorry.
You control one character of unspecified gender called Ren.
This RPG does not have random encounters, but instead random events are spread out on the map. They can be good (treasures) or bad (battles), and most of them can be skipped by walking around.
In very rare cases, you may be blocked by a battle you cannot win yet. It's time to go back to the city to buy better equipment/spells!


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     2.1 BATTLE SYSTEM                                  [A100]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

The game uses a narrative turn-based battle system.

On your turn, you chose what you want to do among all the possible commands (item, ability, party member or special commands). The monsters you will face are vulnerable to some but not all commands, so you have to figure out their weak points. The game helps you keep track by highlighting winning actions and striking losing ones.
Some commands trigger a special interaction depending on their types. This is all detailed in section [A500]. Some of these special interaction can result in your hit missing if you fail them, but do not fear: there's a pity system in the game, and after two failed attempt the third one is guaranteed to work!

After the attack phase comes a defense phase. If you do not win the fight immediately, your opponent often retaliates and you have to avoid their assault in a small dodging mini game. The mini game is simple: the enemy attacks in a direction, and you have to avoid it. You have some time before the attack to place a bet and some time after the attack to correct it. The timing and behavior is different between enemies, some stick to the same direction, other are more unpredictable.

Sometimes you need several hits of the same command to vanquish your enemy. Also some items are consumables (arrows, elixirs...) so be sure to stock up!
All monsters vulnerabilities are listed in section [F000]. They may be arbitrary and sometimes a bit weird, meaning-wise, but I think it's part of the fun of the game, and at least they are balanced between all the different builds.


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     2.2 PARTY                                          [A200]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

In this game, up to 14 companions can join your party. They can help you in battles or trigger random specific events. Some of them are more effective in some situations than others. Here is a list of their abilities:

- Best Friend: Persuasive Argument, Gentle Conversion, Communicative Kindness
- Precious Child: Angelic Smile, Contagious Innocence, Heartful Candor
- Mystical Klutz: Terrifying Predictions, Embarrassing Visions, Dearly Departure
- Sly Swindler: Flying Raptors, Wildlife Stampede, Slithering Reptiles
- Wise Elder: Tetanic Meditation, Blissful Rapture, Material Detachment
- Suspicious Chef: Convoluted Alliances, Inevitable Betrayal, Strategic Negotiations
- Savage Girl: Feral Rage, Feline Assault, Wild Pounce
- Genius Prodigy: Optimal Computation, Outsmarting Tactics, Unfaillable Plan
- Wordly Seductress: Deadly Kiss, Bewitching Whisper, Enthralling Temptation
- Undercover Noble: Elaborate Trap, Chemical Powder, Strongest Potions
- Brawny Simpleton: Wrestling Tackle, Torrential Blows, Berserker Charge
- Tortured Maverick: Relatable Hopelessness, Unbearable Cringe, Infectious Despair
- Retired Protector: Inferiority Retreat, Dominance Reputation, Admirative Awe
- Wealthy Brat: Influencing Fame, Corruptive Bribe, Money Throw

The Best Friend joins your team automatically as part of the story. For the others, refer to section 6 [E000] for a guide about how to get them.


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     2.3 EXPERIENCE                                     [A300]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

This game has two main progression mechanics.
The first is easy, you get gold, you buy equipment. Note that you'll very rarely find gold directly on the floor or on monsters, you need to sell the junk you find on them. That's for realism I guess.
The other one is experience. It is used to learn abilities in the various schools of magic. You gain experience pretty much every time you do a random event, even if it's a story one. But the experience you gain from combats is a bit particular. You don't get experience by killing monsters, but by discovering and trying out new possibilities. You'll get the same amount of experience whether you win or lose a fight.
For instance, if you get a new weapon, you'll get experience when you encounter a monster (you discover that you can use the weapon) and again when you use the weapon against the monster for the first time (you discover its effects).
You can therefore level up just by seeing new monsters and failing to kill them.
You can see the tree of all actions discovered and explored in the Experiences menu.
Once you've explored enough of an enemy's tree (typically when you've killed an enemy a few different ways), it will unlock "EMPATHY": you will see the true silhouette of the enemy, not just a flat shape, and you'll get a humorous text in this menu detailing the destiny of the enemy.


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     2.3 MARTYRDOM                                      [A400]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Another important mechanic in this game is Martyrdom. It's pretty unique, and you probably cannot beat the game without it, so pay attention to it. You gain martyrdom every time you die. There's even an option to suicide in the martyrdom menu. You can then spend the martyrdom points in game changing abilities:

- Dodge speed: you get faster, so the enemies you have to dodge are slower.
- Dodge precision: you get more precise in dodging, so the attack zone from the enemy hit is smaller.
- Dodge predictability: you get better at reading the enemy, so the direction in which you have to dodge tend to be the same.

- Barter skill: you pay less to buy items, and gain more coins when you sell items.
- Learning rate: learning new abilities cost less XP points.

- Walking speed: you walk and run faster.
- Sight range: the annoying fog of war square around you widens and you can see further away.

The first few points in any domain provide a significant improvement, so it could be a good idea to spread out your investment, especially since mastery is more and more expensive.
Walking speed and sight range are mostly quality of life and therefore useless.
Dodge speed and dodge precision are must haves if you want to finish the game.
Walking speed and Sight range also help for some attack interactions (see details of [A500]).
It's worth noting that if you invest enough in barter, you can buy any item cheaper than you can sell it, and get infinite money, but it takes a while to get there.


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     2.3 CHARACTER ARCHETYPES                           [A500]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

There are 6 categories of archetypes to chose from, 3 based on items (money) and 3 based on abilities (XP). You can mix-and-match or specialize, but it's a good idea to get powerful spells and weapons since late game monsters will not be affected by the cheap ones. They seem to be overall pretty balanced with no clear winner, so chose something that fits your playstyle!
The prices indicated here are the base prices and will be affected by your martyrdom levels (see [A400]).
The trainers and shops can be found in the game's cities, but not all cities carry all archetypes, and they don't have the same offerings. Typically the strongest weapons and powers are only found in the optional or final cities.

=== Item based archetypes

Way of the Alchemy [A501]
-------------------------
Fire Elixir ....................... 5 Coins
Ice Elixir ........................ 10 Coins
Vine Elixir ....................... 15 Coins
Venom Elixir ...................... 25 Coins
Decay Elixir ...................... 40 Coins
Chaos Elixir ...................... 50 Coins
Elixirs are consumed on usage. However, after each use, you have the chance to chose between four aim directions, one of which will give you your item back. It's completely random, so I have no tips for you here.
The master of Alchemy is in the town of acceptance.

Way of the Weapon [A502]
------------------------
Wooden Sword ...................... 20 Coins
Dagger ............................ 50 Coins
Mace .............................. 75 Coins
Shield ............................ 200 Coins
Spear ............................. 250 Coins
Iron Sword ........................ 500 Coins
Axe ............................... 600 Coins
Great Sword ....................... 1000 Coins
On using a weapon, you'll need to confirm your hit by clicking or taping on a small silhouette of your oponent. If you miss, your hit will not do anything. Note that the more expensive your weapon, the easier it is to aim (the longer you have to target). The martyrdom "enemy predictability" will reduce the zone where the enemy can be, whereas "dodge speed" will also help you out-speeding your opponent. Interestingly, I think the game is a bit more generous with time if you're moving with the keyboard.
You can find masters of Weapons in the town of acceptance and denial.

Way of the Tool [A503]
----------------------
Arrow ............................. 2 Coins
Laced Darts ....................... 5 Coins
Rope .............................. 100 Coins
Bow ............................... 150 Coins
Net ............................... 200 Coins
Arrows and darts are consumed on usage. You cannot use arrows without a bow, but once you have one they are a great cheap projectile that can hurt a lot of monsters (though you need many hits).
The interaction on hit is a mix of the two above: consumables can be gained back like Alchemy [A501], and non consumables can miss like Weapon [A502].
You can find masters of Tool in the town of acceptance and denial.

=== XP based archetypes

Way of the Element [A504]
-------------------------
Fireball .......................... 50 XP
Ice Bolt .......................... 150 XP
Thunder ........................... 250 XP
Storm ............................. 500 XP
Asphyxiate ........................ 750 XP
Earthquake ........................ 2000 XP
Incinerate ........................ 3000 XP
Summon ............................ 7500 XP
The interaction action is like a slot machine with two symbols: if stops when you tap/click, so you can either trust your luck or your skill. If you use a strong ability, the slots go slower and are more in sync. After a certain threshold it seems that the elements start in sync so you can win straight away if you're quick.
The master of Element is in the town of acceptance.

Way of the Spirit [A505]
------------------------
Poison ............................ 75 XP
Shrink ............................ 200 XP
Petrify ........................... 500 XP
Confusion ......................... 2000 XP
Lull .............................. 5000 XP
Charm ............................. 7500 XP
The interaction is pretty simple: a dot flashes in front of you and you have to tap on it. The stronger the ability, the longer the flash. It is also affected by the "sight range" martyrdom (probably for balance).
The master of Spirit is in the town of denial.

Way of the Diplomat [A506]
--------------------------
Circumvent ........................ 100 XP
Sneak ............................. 250 XP
Persuade .......................... 750 XP
Intimidate ........................ 2000 XP
Mystify ........................... 7500 XP
The interaction here is quite interesting: you pick a position on a graph describing potential psychology of your oponent, and if your prediction overlaps with their actual psyche, you win. The psyche of the monster is different for each battle but stays the same within a battle so you can use your memory :) A stronger ability and a high "enemy predictability" martyrdom will make your guess into a bigger zone, increasing the chances to catch the enemy.
The master of Diplomat is in the town of indulgence.

=== Other archetypes

Way of the Artifact [A507]
--------------------------
This game contains 4 legendary weapons that can kill pretty much anything in one shot. They are in the four optional dungeons. If you struggle against bosses for instance, you might want to do one of these optional dungeons to get the most powerful equipment in the game. They are:
- The Legendary Staff in the Woods of the Trees [D300]
- The Holy Sword in the Sea of the Sirens [D400]
- The Enchanted Wand in the Mounts of the Hawks [D500]
- The Mighty War Hammer in Caves of the Slimes [D600]
See the sections about those dungeons to know how to find them.

Your party [A508]
-----------------
During your adventure, you are joined by your Best Friend, as well as up to 13 side characters (see [A200] for their presentation and [E000] for how to get each one).
Of course, they will come to your help in battle. They are called just like any weapon or ability, and they likewise have strengths and weaknesses. They have no hit interaction, so they can get special quotes and theme song.
They're especially nice in boss fights, as any of your allies can take down any boss if given sufficient attempts.

===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     2.3 OPTIONS                                        [A600]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Like any game, this one has an option menu, but there are a few elements that I think bear pointing out:
- You can change the color scheme of the minimalist art style at any time, it's randomly generated.
- There's a checkbox to display dialogs instantly, in case you want to try and use a translation software.
- You can chose the order of commands during a battle: do you want to see winning option first (to go fast) or the options you havent tried yet (to explore) first??
- Finally, this game has an interesting approach to difficulty: you can set it with a "challenge" slider, which will make your dodges and attacks either a breeze or hell! Adjust it to make it just right for your playstyle! I wonder why there isnt more games using this kind of difficulty slider...

===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     3. BASE STORYLINE                                  [B000]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     3.1. HIDE AND SEEK                                 [B100]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

The game starts by a bit of lore, and then puts you in control of an innocent child (Ren) playing a game of hide and seek.
After choosing the perfect name for your avatar, you must find 5 children hidden in the trees by interacting with them. It's easy enough to try them all, but just for the record they are in 10 o'clock, 1 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 5 o'clock and the center.
You may want to talk to the children after having found them to chose appropriate names for Best Friend and Precious Child.
Once you've found them all, priests come fetch you for a mysterious trial. Talk to them on the right side of the screen.
They bring you to a church and explain that since you are the second born in your family, you need to take a mysterious trial to see if you are chosen by the Goddess as the Promised Child. Your odds do not sound good.
Prepare yourself psychologically, save at the altar at the center of the room, and then talk to the priest at the top of the screen to start your doomed trial.


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     3.2. THE TRIAL                                     [B200]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

You fall through a hole in the ground into a maze, but before you can do anything, the first boss battle is already on you.

o------------------------------o---------------------------------------------o
| BOSS: Basilisk               |                                             |
|------------------------------|                                             |
|                                                                            |
| You can only do two things: try to run away, and cry for help.             |
| Both options lead to your doom, so pick whatever you want, and it's game   |
| over.                                                                      |
| But wait! You can retry the event (or load your save), and this time a new |
| option "Pray" appears! Try it to draw the attention of the Goddess!        |
| This time, when the Basilisk attacks, you get a chance to dodge! He's      |
| really really slow, so it shouldn't be an issue, and it'll give you a      |
| comfortable taste of the dodging system.                                   |
| After that, you can "Swear loyalty" and pledge your soul to the Goddess    |
| to summon a divine rescue. You made it!                                    |
|                                                                            |
o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Now that the Goddess saved you from the fangs of the Basilisk, you find yourself in a labyrinth from where you must escape!

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| Trial                                                                      |
o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| VIPER: vulnerable to Bone, Stick, Wooden Sword, Fire Elixir
| RODENT: vulnerable to Bone, Fang, Fire Elixir
| COCKROACH: vulnerable to Fang, Stone, Fire Elixir
| ARACHNID: vulnerable to Stone, Wooden Sword, Fire Elixir
o

This section is a bit particular because you don't have spells or weapons yet, so you have to fight with whatever you can get your hands on.
In your starter area, you can find a Bone in a Bone pile and a Stone.
From there on, you need to make your way to the periphery of the maze. There's many ways to do so, I will present you one possibility. Feel free to wander around, you can gather quite a few Fire Elixir, various junk to sell and even a Wooden Sword rotting in this maze.
You can start by going left, where after defeating a rodent with your bone you'll find your predecessor who did not get a very happy fate.
Go back to the starting point, and now go south. You will defeat a spider, then go south. At the intersection, go east, and then you can safely go towards the south. Once you've reached the border of the maze, follow it towards the west, and you'll see what this maze is really about.

The maze forms a square, and in the middle of each side is a statue of the Goddess. These four statues will give you clues to a riddle you must solve. It does not matter in what order you visit the statues, and they will always remind you of your previous clues so you don't need to write them down.
The first statue you observe tells you that you are looking for a phrase of the form *** ******* **. You can already look closer to reveal a few letters of the solution.
Each other statue will give you clues about one of the words in the form of a poem, accompanied by a few letters.
I'll consider that the game gives you enough clues to figure it out on your own, and that if you're here, you want the solution.
Go to any statue and give it the solution with the option "Speak". The solution is "act through me".
After that, just touch the statue, and prepared to be celebrated as the champion of the Goddess!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Everyone is overjoyed by your success. But this little town is not well equipped to guide you for the tasks that await you. Talk to the priest in the top of the screen to get all the information you want, and it's time to make your way to the capital for a proper training!
As soon as you exit the building, you are joined by your Best Friend, the first party member.
You can take a moment if you want to explore the town of Hope.

Once you're satisfied, go to the border of the town in any direction to get out.
Your objective is the town of Fear. The position is randomly generated, but it should be roughly north and a little east from where you are.
Note that at this point you have access to most of the world to explore to your heart's content, but we'll follow the story here. Refer to section [D000] for all the optional content.
Don't venture too far, though, as the rest of the world map has significantly harder enemies.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

The town of Fear is north-east of the town of Hope. It is the capital of the kingdom, as you can tell by the size and the royal castle.
Go to the church, where you'll find trainers, and a head priest that will explain to you your best chance at taking down the demon lord. You'll have to find three fragments of an ancient weapon and assemble it. The order in which you do does not matter much, so you're free to tackle the challenge any way you want.
Before you leave, make sure to go to the Alchemy shop west of the town to get a Breathing potion. You'll need it later.
Feel free to explore this little town, it has a lot to offer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

You can tackle the three dungeons that hold the pieces of armament in any order.
The Mushroom Forest is east of the capital,
The Squid Lake is north-west of the capital,
The Harpies Peak is south-east of the capital.

Don't forget to make use of Martyrdom or else the bosses may give you a tough time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

To enter this zone, you need a Breathing Potion. It's sold in the town of Fear, at the Alchemy shop.

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| Squid Lake                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| MONSTERS: Anemone, Crab, Anglerjelly, Jellyfish, Octopus, Squid
o

This zone is a big open lake. You need to find among all the random events the one for the boss. Once again, feel free to explore, loot, level up. All the events' positions are random, but the boss is consistently on the top left, around the 10 o'clock direction, a little away from the border.

o------------------------------o---------------------------------------------o
| BOSS: Whale                  |                                             |

| This boss is a bit peculiar as the fight cannot be won. When you're        |
| satisfied with your tries, pick the FEED option and let yourself be eaten  |
| by the whale.                                                              |

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Once in this anatomically correct replica of a whale's insides, follow the digestive track. The Ancient Armament Armature is on the bottom right of the first stomach. Make your way out through an... unholy way, and swim back to the surface the way you came.

o

You need to climb to the summit of the mountain, but there's also a key to pick up on the way.
Go up through the little sinuous way, and go up at the fork. You reach a clearing with a little path going west. Follow it to find a skeleton that you can search for a key.
Make your way back to the clearing, go up and follow the path. You'll be able to reach the top in no time.

After defeating the boss, use the key to open the shelter door. You'll find the Ancient Armament Ammunition on the top right of the main room.
Exit the way you came.

                     3.6. THE ANCIENT ARMAMENT                          [B600]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Back in the city of Fear, you find that it has been devastated by the armies of the demon lord. If only you had known, you could have prevented this! You will be able to in your next playthrough.
The Head Priest is still there, and directs you to the next phase of your mission: you'll now head to the south east to fight the demon lord in Hell's Maw.

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| World map: rest of the world                                               |

o

Hell's Maw is at the very south-east of the map, but the Head Priest suggests that you can stop at the city of Denial, slightly north-west of Hell's Maw, to resupply. That being said, the town is in total denial, and will be of little help (except for its great shops), so feel free to skip and go directly to Hell's Maw.

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| Town of Denial                                                               |

===============================================================================

Welcome to Hell's Maw! This vulcano is a little maze-y but not to worry I can get you through!

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| Hell's Maw                                                                 |

| Serpentine, Toad, Warlock
o

As usual, there's tons of XP and items to grab. The way forward can be reached by going LEFT, UP, RIGHT, UP.
You arrive at a weird clearing (the summit). Go either up or down and you'll see that it repeats infinitely. But most importantly, you'll face a giant demon!
Interact with him...


o------------------------------o---------------------------------------------o

| Now to fight what appears to be the lord of the demons. You can escape,    |
| but attacking with result in your death.                                   |
| Use the ancient armament. Sadly, it fails.                                 |
| But something is off. You can now use the Notice command and remark that   |
| this is not the demon lord, but his trusty lieutenant!                     |
| He tells you much about the lore, but the most important information is    |
| in the Artifact command: the demons are invincible to your weapon because  |
| they were precisely here in response to human technological advances!      |
| Pick "it's our fault" when asked what the reason for the demon invasion    |
| was, and you'll build a surprisingly cordial relationship with the demon   |
| lieutenant.                                                                |
| He suggest that you can find out more by exploring ruins, so let's do just |
| that.                                                                      |

The place you're looking for is called Forgotten Fissure, and is pretty close to Hell's Maw, a little bit west. Interact with the crack to go down the cave.

This dungeon appears to be some sort of temple to humanism. It's vaguely shaped like a human body, so I'll use this to direct you.
This is another dungeon where you progress by solving riddles. The answers are given to you in the form of random events.
The final boss is at the top, in the head. You can access it straight away (the password is "dead"), but otherwise the usual path is:
- Clue in the middle of the room: "nothing"
- You can go to the top-right room (arm), the second clue is at the end of the room: "everything"
- This allows you access to the top-left room, which gives you the clue: "myself"
- You can now enter the bottom-right (leg) room, which gives you the next clue: "me"
- This opens the way to the final room at the bottom-left, where you find the final password.
Whether you did the long way or the short, go up, say "dead", and enter the last room.
A beast is guarding the secret you're after.

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Slaying the boss, you can now inspect the ruins to discover that destroyed the civilization of your ancestors: they got too full of themselves, too prideful and arrogant, lost their faith and completely abandoned the Goddess, venerating themselves instead. Without the Goddess' protection, nothing prevented demons to conquer their world!
At this point, you realize that no man made technology is going to get you out of this mess, and you decide to trust your divine guide and throw a final (dare I say suicide?) assault on Hell's Maw.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

You're about to reach a point of no return, so this is an ideal time to explore optional content if you feel like it (see section [D000]). You won't have access to it afterwards, until the New Game + mode. You'll still be able to buy, sell and train so don't worry too much though :)
It's also a good time to shop, train and level up your martyrdom (especially the dodge stuff!) since you're about to go against the demon army pretty much on your own.
Go back to Hell's Maw, east of the fissure, and make your way to the lieutenant  (LEFT, UP, RIGHT, UP).
Now, it's time to fight with brute force, bare hands and blind faith!
This is now a "normal" battle.

At the end of the battle, things go sour. While dying, the Lieutenant causes a terrible explosion and your Best Friend tragically does not make it.
After an emotional goodbye, you decide to continue your mission to honor this sacrifice. Take a moment to mourn, and then exit the screen on the left.
You're not in your world anymore, welcome to hell!

In the north west of the map, you'll find altars that stand in for late game trainer and sellers. They can teach you and sell you absolutely anything, so don't hesitate to finish your build!
The altars form a sort of circle, and your destination, the Castle of the Demon Lord, is in the middle.
When you're ready, head there!

o

I quite like the monsters here, they use quite original psychological attacks, they're pretty inventive when it comes to hurting you.
Anyway you find yourself in a castle that occasionally doubles as a slimy demon spawning ground. You'll have to climb the floors to reach the demon lord at the very top. Each floor needs a key to go to the next one, which you can find in the small rooms around the main room. There's a pattern to the location of the keys:
- Floor 1: Bottom left, Key to Survival
- Floor 2: Top right, Key to Progress
- Floor 3: Top left, Key to Success
- Floor 4: Bottom right, Key to Happiness
- Floor 5: Bottom left, Key to Understanding
- Floor 6: Top Right, Key to Victory
Floor 7 is mostly occupied by the massive silhouette of the Demon Lord. This time it's really him.
It's time to avenge your best friend! Save, and face your hardest boss battle yet! Make sure you have an adequate weapon or spell, because not much can hurt this guy.

After the battle, things get a bit suspicious. You get a confirmation dialog to ask if you actually want to kill him, but you don't have any other choice. And when you finally slay him, he seems more relieved than in pain...
There's much, much more to discover in this game, starting for what is behind this bizarre sequence. You actually barely scratched the surface. You could stop here, but it would be a shame. Because New Game + is waiting for you, and it will let you see behind the scenes of this world. Let me tell you, it holds quite a few surprises.
For now you can take a breath and revel in the glory of your victorious quest. Enjoy it while it lasts.
The game rewards you with a hopeful description of the peace you brought, the prosperity of the human kingdom and how you honor the legacy of your fallen comrade.

                     4. META-GAME AND ENDINGS                           [C000]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

But right after the game also tells you that, things end up taking a turn: drunk on their own prosperity, humans are turning away from the Goddess. Now where have I seen that before?
The Goddess finally withdraws her protection, and a new wave of demons take over the land. The title appears: it's time for Ren's Demons II. And we're once again looking for a Promised Child.
The meta-structure of the game is now revealed: you are trapped in some sort of cycle, from which you must escape.
Fortunately, the game is designed for that, and exploring these loops is made quite easy. You'll get incredible powers on the way, and it will lead you to the 7 possible endings.


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     4.1. END OF WAR                                    [C100]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

By now, you already know the first ending: the End of War is what happens when you kill the demon lord. It's the mandatory step to unlock the post-game/new game +/meta-loop or whatever you want to call it. It's also the least interesting, so let's move on :)
Next time you'll fight the demon lord, you will have the option to spare him (though the game will test your determination ^^).


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     4.2. META-GAME POWERS                              [C200]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

After the end of war, things change quite a bit to make it easy for you to explore the meta-game.
You can use your knowledge of the adventure to avoid the mistakes of the previous playthrough: you can warn the priests of the city of Fear about the impending attack to save them, you can skip the construction of the Ancient Armament which you know doesn't work, you can skip the whole bit about going to the Forgotten Fissure since you know the lesson already. Basically you can just go straight to Hell's Maw if you want, or explore only optional content [D000]. The only thing you cannot seem to avoid is the death of your Best Friend :,(
Furthermore, after the End of War, you're kinda required to go back to the Pandemonium, but after that you can use save and load to save-scum and rush your way through exploring the different endings.

After each ending, your XP goes back to zero, but every time you meet a monster you regain all the XP from this fight all at once, allowing you to catch up in XP pretty fast. The text events also provide you with more XP. There's nothing for coins, except if you've invested in the barter martyrdom in which case you could get a fortune pretty fast.

Another thing that changes is the fog of war: it becomes translucent and allows you to see things around you. You can see that the decor only exists in your immediate vicinity and disappears when you walk away. You can also peek at the thoughts of all the NPCs who seem less than thrilled about having to play their role for you. It seems that everything is orchestrated for you. Make of that what you will, but I'll include my thoughts in sections [H100] and [H200].
By the way, this is a good time to tell you that this game being a web browser game, you can access the javascript debug console (ctrl+shift+j). It's even included in the "options" on mobile. It shows you the flip side of the game. Among the debug messages, you see all these NPC complaints.

As you progress in the meta-game, you'll unlock new powers in battle. After the End of War, you'll be able to Spoil the enemies for which you have empathy (see [A300]). Letting them know you're on to their little scheme will cause you to instantly win the fight.
Later, after the End of God, you also gain more control over the game engine (see [C500]), and you can dictate the outcome of each fight (WIN or LOSS).

Finally, another thing that changes is that from now on, you'll have glitches every now and then featuring the Goddess begging you to stop and changing the colors of your game and the audio speed. They really start picking up if you refuse to kill the demon lord.


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     4.3. HEAVEN                                        [C300]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Make your way through the storyline skipping what you want (see [C200]), and defeat the Demon Lord again at the top of the Pandemonium. But this time, at the end of the fight, chose the new option to spare him.
The Demon Lord will reveal that he was just following the Goddess' orders, and She is not very happy about that! He kills himself in fear, leaving you to wonder the true character of the Goddess. It looks like she purposefully unleashed the demons she was pretending to fight. Not so holy after all :)
Make your way down and out of the Pandemonium, and you'll see a new zone north that just appeared: heaven!
Head there to, in pure JRPG fashion, take on God!

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| Heaven                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| MONSTERS: Angel, Cherub, Maneki, Ponpon, Raijuu, Seraph, Valkyrie
o

The enemies here go even one step further than the ones in Pandemonium: their attacks are often psychological, but they seem directed at the player, not the character.

Heaven is a weird place. It's very hard to get any kind of bearing, everything changes all the time and you get catapulted out of it seemingly randomly. the decor changes with every fight and every screen with four possibilities: clouds, tombs, bookshelves or lab experiments.
The clouds are just decorative.
The lab experiments will confirm that the demons originate from here, letting you fight all the creatures and bosses in the game.
The tomb illustrate how many NPCs, companions and so on... were sacrificed on your journey.
But the screen we're most interested in is the one with bookshelves: they contain the life stories being written for everyone in the world, including Ren! Looking at the book for your life, you'll notice that it describes a path to get through this maze to the Goddess.

You do not have to look for the books, though. If you want, you can follow the path yourself, straight away. People knowledgeable of videogame history might recognize this path:
Go UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, and then finally RIGHT (a mythical sequence known as Konami Code).
You'll find yourself facing the Goddess Herself. It's time for the final (?) fight!
Make sure you save before the fight, in case you want to come back and explore alternative endings faster.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Talk to the massive silhouette to begin the fight.

o------------------------------o---------------------------------------------o
| BOSS: Goddess                |                                             |
|------------------------------|                                             |
|                                                                            |
| This fight is pretty straightforward: there's only one option, "Kill God", |
| that you must use 7 times to succeed.                                      |
|                                                                            |
o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

The ending of the fight is reminiscent of the one with Demon Lord: some things seem unexplained/unsaid. The Goddess too seem almost happy to be defeated... But the solution to this mystery is for later! For now, enjoy the End of God!
Though the peace it brought did not last long! It seems that after the end of god, humanity will just create a new one :)


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     4.5. MIRACLES                                      [C500]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

The meta-game/new game + already gave you new powers (see [C200]), but it takes a whole new level after the End of God. The question marks in the menu are finally dispelled and you have access to the "Miracles" menu.
This menu gives you godlike powers over the very fabric of the game world by manipulating directly the game engine. Note that if you're into programming, you've always been able to use these powers from the debug console (ctrl+shift+j). They are attached to the library called "THAUMATURGY". The game even includes a documentation at: https://github.com/yo252yo/rensdemons/blob/master/man.md
Of course, doing so, you open yourself to the possibility of bugs.

- Space/Time compression: changes the base parameters of reality. Space will mostly affect the display zoom, but playing with time could be useful to make you run or dodge faster.
- Teleport: clicks become teleports
- Smite: clicks destroy whatever you click on. This is pretty dangerous
- Fast travel: go instantly to any city
- White Space: an empty room you can teleport to, ideal to experiment with the next option
- Summon: allows you to summon any monster/object in front of you. A must for completionists
- Recolor reality: the same as the option to change color
- Glitch: you can trigger a glitch yourself
- Display event content: very useful if you're looking for a specific type of random encounter
- Clairvoyance: removes the fog in the viewport
- Astral Farsight: allows you to use scrolling to see where you're not
- Absolute observer: makes sure that the decor and NPC further away from you don't blink out of existence (more explanations in [H200])
- You can also get all items, party members, abilities or martyrdoms in one click

This is obviously very powerful, and you will be able to ask the Goddess how you got these powers.

                     4.6. END OF SUFFERING/END OF THE WORLD             [C600]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Load or go back to the Goddess to explore the two next endings.
Now that you know what happens if you kill her, new options are available: Denounce and Negotiate. Both lead to lore dumps in which the Goddess explains that she's simply answering a basic human need, and that's why she always comes back. Depending on how the conversation goes, Ren has two possible ideas:
- put an end to the suffering in the world (typically after Negociate). This will have the unintended consequence of suppressing the whole world, since everything can be a source of suffering, and a new world will emerge with just as much suffering.
- destroy and remake a better world (Denounce -> Believers -> Change World -> Fix the world -> Destroy world), which will end in the same way: the new world also cannot be rid of suffering, which gives birth to a new Goddess.
The situation seems pretty hopeless. But after all trying both of these failed attempts, the next time you meet the Goddess, a new option will appear!


===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     4.7. THE TRUTH                                     [C700]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

You can now use "Notice" on the Goddess to try and properly befriend her.

o------------------------------o---------------------------------------------o
| BOSS: Goddess (befriending)  |                                             |
|------------------------------|                                             |
|                                                                            |
| This fight is also straightforward and leaves you only one option at a     |
| time. The Goddess is not happy about it, and her attacks will be stronger  |
| than before (the strongest in the game). But using your miraculous powers, |
| surely you can get strong enough to prevail.                               |
| Anyway the order of attacks is imposed:                                    |
| Notice -> Sympathize -> Empathize -> BestFriend                            |
| After which the attacks will stop and you can have a proper talk.          |
|                                                                            |
o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

After this brawl, the Goddess finally gives in and tells you what she knows.

... the truth

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Because of the structure of the game (see [C000]), most of its content is optional for you to discover at your own pace. Some of it is pretty interesting, so don't be scared to try!
In particular, that's how you get most of your party members as well as the four ultimate artifacts, the most powerful weapons in the game. You're limited to one of them in your first playthrough (before the End of War) but after that you're free as a bird.
