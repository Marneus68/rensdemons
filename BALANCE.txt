each action is 3xp (when discovered and when explored)

trial is about 7*4 actions,
=> up to 84 xp

items is 11 * 5 actions
=> up to 165 xp

villager is 10 * 4 versions of each actions
=> up to 120 xp


so rn about 360 xp max

After town2: 211xp, 39 coins but i have a dagger
My first dungeon got me 150xp, 100 gold
