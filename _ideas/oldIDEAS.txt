and the title screen “Ultimate Illusion I” (in reference to Final Fantasy). We discover Ren, a young boy living in a grim medfan society where the church captures children and tortures them to try and find the Chosen One inhabited by the power of God who can resist and counter the torture.
Ren is that Chosen One, and this dire fate will awaken him to his power: he can go back in time to a previous instant through the save game mechanism and exploit the die and retry mechanism.
From there, he’ll embark on a typical RPG quest to slay the demon lord (in service of the Church or against the Church??).

## Key concepts
- The Player is God.
- God created the game world which only exists for Them.
- Ren is the Chosen One and the Vessel of God’s Will.
- The field of percept of the Player is the game viewport, nothing exists outside of it a la Berkeley.
- the cool thing about Berkeley’s philosophy is that you litteraly make your own universe

We have to find three artifacts to make an old weapon:

4 extra dungeons for the ultimate weapons

when he comes back town 2 gets raided and destroyed (can be prevented in NG+)

side quest to barbarian encampment to try and find survivors

he goes to town 3 to prepare assault

Charges on the gates of hell, AA fails


find the lost temple of the goddess (in a cave)
Learn that maou attacked because elders lost faith, and thereby weakened goddess protec

Charges again gates of hell, this time success

In otherworld, immediately fight Maou,
- learning he's lieutenant of dark god of chaos
- Maou kills BF

New world: Hell, no town, but mb a few side events. giant open world, cause fuck open worlds

EFight againts God
Ending 1: "but im not the true villain, there will be more/worse"
Ending 2: "im serving the goddess, im just doing her will"
Ending 3: Kill the goddess
Ending 4: you are the goddess all along

From then on meta endings

----------

The system makes this villain self sustaining cycle to provide a diversion
It's basically matrix

1. Kill the bad guy
2. Bad guy isn't so bad
3. You're trapped by the System
4. You are the system

And then you figure out that the system =goddess =you


>>Video-game ideology  = only allows you to move within the game


Defeat subdemon -> defeat demon -> goddess is revealed as true villain -> exorcise from goddess -> godess is revealed as player’s avatar -> defeat godess
- good end = stop playing, true end = forking the game on github




## Concept
This is a game about Berkeley’s philosophy highlighting that the world only exists when perceived. The main point is that the world and the NPCs only exist when they are on screen: they only exist for the player and because of them. The title is a reference to Descarte’s demons.

## Beginning
The game opens up to the quote “Insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results”, and the title screen “Ultimate Illusion I” (in reference to Final Fantasy). We discover Ren, a young boy living in a grim medfan society where the church captures children and tortures them to try and find the Chosen One inhabited by the power of God who can resist and counter the torture.
Ren is that Chosen One, and this dire fate will awaken him to his power: he can go back in time to a previous instant through the save game mechanism and exploit the die and retry mechanism.
From there, he’ll embark on a typical RPG quest to slay the demon lord (in service of the Church or against the Church??).

## Key concepts
- The Player is God.
- God created the game world which only exists for Them.
- Ren is the Chosen One and the Vessel of God’s Will.
- The field of percept of the Player is the game viewport, nothing exists outside of it a la Berkeley.
- the cool thing about Berkeley’s philosophy is that you litteraly make your own universe

## Ending
The main quest ends when Ren slays the Demon Lord. From there, we learn that it’s all well and fine but this was all a small part of something bigger, someone is pulling the strings in the dark, and peace can’t last and another evil appeared. Ren is back to the beginning, the game is reset (levels back to 0, etc…). Procedural generation changes little details of the world. We get a title screen for “Ultimate Illusion N+1”, and the story goes on infinitely, mirroring the endless cycle of consumption of modern gaming.

## True end
This infinite loop of resets has no end in the game. There will always be another challenge as long as the player exists. This highlights the fact that the player is the true source of evil in the game world, because all this suffering only exists for their experience. The true boss that you must defeat is the player, the one who orchestrated all these Demon Lords, and the only way to kill it is to literally stop playing: the only winning move is not to play.
The main challenge is to make the player understand this without it being in the game, otherwise it becomes just another part of the conspiracy. The idea is to make the game seem odd and glitchy to tickle the player’s curiosity, so that players will google it and find walkthrough and extra documentation I put online to explain the situation.
- Sometimes the game would crash with a very peculiar error code.
- The final confrontation text hints at “maybe you missed something”.
- Maybe an option in the game main menu to open a chrome tab to gamefaqs?
- The game creates log files on disk (and in the java console) with the thoughts of the NPCs trapped.
The important thing is that the player is no longer fighting within the game, they are fighting against the game, and against themselves (the player/self). It must be clear that the player is the true boss.

## Main quest
The point of the game may be in its loopy ending and twist, but I think we can and should seize the rich concept of the game to make the main quest an enjoyable experience. Ren will awaken to his powers that are:
- Leverage die and retry mechanism as first class citizen
- Metaknowledge about the game and the world (this is a boss fight so…)
- Nothing exists outside his perceptions (not sure how we can use that)
Which should be enough to provide an interesting gimmicky riddle solving game.

## NPCs behavior
The NPCs only exist for the player and their experience, much like the Truman Show, except we can’t afford the Experience to have obvious problems (otherwise the problems would be part of the experience).
The NPC’s POV is present within the game as an overly religious society (they’re all obsessed with God, complaining about Him or praising Him). Some of them are grateful to be given the chance to live, other are bitter about being trapped in existence, other are terrified of falling off the viewport, other are overly worried that their performance will please God. They also complain in the logs (java console or on disk files) a bit more directly about the game.
- Everything was fine before God came along (// the cake is a lie)
- But there was nothing before God
The goal is that everything seems like normal religious obsessed medfan until the players reaches the true end and realise they are literally God.

Rens demons completely alternate rendering engine which makes something totally different but the same


- Crash with error messags “help us”
- When you go to game folder, theres a debug.exe game that launches the same environments behind the scenes?
- Save and load : rez someone to kill them again
- Someone dies in the first boss fight and u want to rez her
- Artist vessel for god inspiration
- The enemy is the you who thinks he's the center of the world the one for whom all this suffering has been created
- By giving attention to an element you make it special and imbue it with meaning, ie le rôle du mec qui n'a pas de rôle
- the only real power of the hero is respawn so they win in long run, cf yuusha yoshihiko
