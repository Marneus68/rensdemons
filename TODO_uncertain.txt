i think the transition between levels is fucked up probably because of concurrency

touch handler interupts boy walking

touch handler interupts text during battle

mota crashed during basilisk figh and it didnt pop again

sometimes events are doubled

some evnets are in walls

when testing i had a viper battle go out of existence

zindex was sometimes broken on mobile
some events dont disappear as they should

animation at the end of clue is weird (blink screen)

- during his demo playthrough M would respawn in the middle of the church every time he enters
- during his demo playthrough M fireball doesnt get crossed when useless

be careful, write in present and second person, also dont make things spawn on doors

- when you enter harpie peak youre spawned on wrong location < fixed with autosave??
