i think the transition between levels is fucked up probably because of concurrency

touch handler interupts boy walking

touch handler interupts text during battle

mota crashed during basilisk figh and it didnt pop again

sometimes events are doubled

some evnets are in walls

when testing i had a viper battle go out of existence

zindex was sometimes broken on mobile
some events dont disappear as they should

animation at the end of clue is weird (blink screen)
