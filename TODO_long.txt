should filler just pass gen to the constructor instead f calling gen.get

menu back->back makes an infinite loop (i.e. impossible to have more than 2 lvls)

if theres a guy behind a house interaction interacts with the house (most prominent object)

make experience menu multi tiered

sounds atmosphere for each town, each villager, each party member
sprite for each party member

put escape actions at the bottom of actions lists

add new decoration items

add rens parent sendoff before trial?

save audio settings to disk!

dedicated sprites and audio themes for party members

decorate stores

sell several items at once

do i need unlock true in unlock_replacing_action

did i fix word break in little textbox but not in CenteredTextMenu ?? https://github.com/yo252yo/rensdemons/commit/45d726acf5d6e3ff75444e5c90bd045d5150fa40 ??

the treasure battler should probs be closed

mb i need to make scroll work even without fog

mb revamp party screen with icons

different sound walking on map

i dont like how we store saved data as hidden abilities and items :P

should the LANGUAGE bits be generated from a pattern (or metapatern)?

at the first boss, retry develops your ability, but loading the previous save forgets about your ability, which is a bit sad

mb i shouldnt save at all LEVLESTATE for stuff like houses

why does battletree have lists as leaves and not simply state?

Reduce the size of Datasets, maybe we can even completely generate it from the markov model? though currently generation doesnt conclude

Skip dodge phase at high level?

Get less weird list of names??

More villager small talk? More objects in house, and diversity within objects?

should we merge the actions in the experience menu if they have the same name?


make item sets (make chair with table)

mb add BestFriend to the party that follows you around, for emotional attachment

add BestFriend to random environemnt interactions but it needs to be conditioned on her beeing alive

party state, thoughts, etc...
