should i make a world map?

menu back->back makes an infinite loop (i.e. impossible to have more than 2 lvls)

save audio settings to disk!

the treasure battler should probs be closed

i dont like how we store saved data as hidden abilities and items :P

should the LANGUAGE bits be generated from a pattern (or metapatern)?

at the first boss, retry develops your ability, but loading the previous save forgets about your ability, which is a bit sad

mb i shouldnt save at all LEVLESTATE for stuff like houses

why does battletree have lists as leaves and not simply state?

Reduce the size of Datasets, maybe we can even completely generate it from the markov model? though currently generation doesnt conclude

Skip dodge phase at high level?

Get less weird list of names??

More villager small talk? More objects in house, and diversity within objects?

should we merge the actions in the experience menu if they have the same name?


make item sets (make chair with table)

remove dashes from markov chain

mb add sidekick to the party that follows you around, for emotional attachment

add sidekick to random environemnt interactions but it needs to be conditioned on her beeing alive
